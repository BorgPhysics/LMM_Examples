During the years following, the US Army found itself increasingly called upon to lead multinational operations in the lower to middle tiers of the range of military operations and conflict continuum. The events of 11 September 2001 led to more than 15 years of intense focus on counterterrorism, counterinsurgency, and stability operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. An entire generation of Army leaders and Soldiers were culturally imprinted by this experience. We emerged as an Army more capable in limited contingency operations than at any time in our nation’s history, but the geopolitical landscape continues to shift and the risk of great power conflict is no longer a remote possibility.\n",

As technology has proliferated and become accessible in even the most remote corners of the world, the US military’s competitive advantage is being challenged across all of the warfighting domains. In the last decade, we have witnessed an emergent China, a revanchist and aggressive Russia, a menacing North Korea, and a cavalier Iranian regime. Each of these adversaries seeks to change the world order in their favor and contest US strategic interests abroad. The chance for war against a peer or regional near-peer adversary has increased exponentially, and we must rapidly shift our focus to successfully compete in all domains and across the full range of military operations.\n",

      "\tThroughout the recorded history of warfare, military planners and commanders have sought to deceive their adversary as to the size, timing, or location of an attack, in order to gain a decisive advantage. From the famous “Trojan Horse” to modern efforts to use the electromagnetic spectrum to “spoof” or “jam” sensors, deception in some form remains an essential component of military operations. Whether attacking an unsuspecting enemy on Christmas morning, as Washington did at Trenton, or emplacing “Quaker guns” (logs painted black to resemble cannon) to provide the impression of strength, US forces have successfully built on a long legacy of military deception (MILDEC) in order to prevail in the nation’s wars. While technology continues to advance at a dizzying pace, threatening to render previous lessons obsolete, MILDEC operations have successfully withstood previous developments and even incorporated new technologies continue to form an important part of combat operations. While potentially capable, in some cases, of enabling military forces to prevail without a fight, as the theorist Sun Tzu postulated, more often MILDEC confers an advantage that helps the side that successfully harnesses it prevail, often at a much lower cost that it would have otherwise. Thus, MILDEC, and its long and successful history, remain an important, even vital, tool for any future leader.\n",

      "\tGiven the voluminous, and excellent, body of literature currently available on military deception, it is certainly worth asking why we need another volume on the topic. This volume is not intended to displace, even if it could, the deeply-researched and lengthy treatises on the long history of military deception operations. Rather, it is intended as a primer, and a thought piece, for how strategists, operational planners, staff officers and, ultimately, commanders, have historically integrated military deception into large-scale combat operations, focusing on the last 100 years of conflict. The individual chapters, while certainly excellent stand-alone treatments of the deception aspects of the operations and campaigns considered, likewise are of insufficient length to become the definitive works on their individual topics. Instead, they build upon the extensive secondary literature, and, in several cases, primary sources in order to provide a comprehensive but accessible understanding of how military deception has successfully enabled victory on the battlefield.\n",

      "\tIf principles of war can be sifted out of military history, as the master, Carl von Clausewitz, attempted to do with Napoleon’s campaigns, then these twelve case studies also ought to provide us with some “universal truths” regarding deception operations. Admittedly, considering successful deceptions, primarily in operations involving the US Army and its principal allies and antagonists, for less than half of its operational life may omit a number of relevant examples. But these cases are sufficient to provide several enduring threads of continuity in successful operations which, most importantly, remain relevant for current and future practitioners. One of the first is the importance of coordination in deception campaigns, especially since the addition of warfare in the third dimension, which coincides with the beginning of this volume. While many thought that the airplane, and later radar and satellite imagery, marked the end of successful deception by pulling back the veil that had shielded terrestrial armies for millennia, instead deception remained a key, if significantly more complicated aspect of many campaigns. While previously deception had to be coordinated between the military and political instruments of national power, now it also had to be practiced in multiple domains simultaneously. In what could be labeled “Multi-Domain Deception,” these plans required close and careful coordination across the warfighting domains, to ensure that lapses in one did not undo efforts in other areas. A heavy bombing campaign focused exclusively on Normandy would have undone the ruse of an Allied landing at\n",

With the proliferation of warfare into space and cyberspace, the difficulty of coordinating a successful deception campaign has expanded exponentially and greatly complicated the efforts of its architects, but it has not made their task impossible.\n",

      "Paragraph ID: 2:\n",
      "\tAnother “principle” that emerges from the narrative is that of the “Magruder Principle,” the idea that it is easier to convince an adversary to hold on to a pre-existing belief that to convince them of a new one. This obviously depends heavily on both intelligence collection, to understand an opposing commander’s estimate of the situation, as well a cultural competency, to understand what key assumptions commanders, militaries, and nations are likely to hold most dear. Once planners have accurately divined an enemy’s strongly-held beliefs, they can then use this knowledge to achieve their goals. Just as a practitioner of the Japanese martial art of jiu-jitsu uses the momentum of an opponent’s punch or lunge to continue movement in a certain direction, but well past the intended point, deception campaigners can use an adversary’s assumptions against them, by reinforcing that belief while simultaneously planning an unexpected operation that catches them off-balance or out of position. While difficult to successfully accomplish, this remains the closest thing to an enduring principle in military deception operations, and forces planners to “mirror image” themselves, and ask what preconceived notions they have that an adversary might turn against them. One of the most famous of the humorous “Murphy’s Rules of War” postulates that “The enemy diversion you are ignoring is his main attack,” accurately describing the successful campaign in Normandy.\n",

      "\tCareful readers of the accounts in this volume will notice that weaker powers tend to favor the use of deception to overcome a stronger opponent. Just as jiu-jitsu enables a smaller fighter to use a larger or more powerful adversary’s strength against them, successful deception operations can enable a weaker force or nation to prevail against a stronger, by dispersing effort or creating a tempo of operations to which a less agile opponent is unable to respond.

      "\tThe book begins with the US Army’s first successful deception operation in a major conflict. As Mark Grotelueschen convincingly argues, the “Belfort Ruse” successfully enabled American, and therefore Allied battlefield success in the First World War by influencing German troop dispositions in France. While relying heavily on its European allies, the US Army demonstrated it was a quick study and incorporated deception operations in future combat operations in almost all of its subsequent conflicts. Brian Drohan continues the focus on the First World War by examining British forces in Palestine, that leveraged deception operations to first outflank Ottoman dispositions on a weakened flank, and then used their adversary’s tendency to expect a repeat of this tactic to drive through a weakly-held coastal sector. The two operations, at Beersheeba and Megiddo, remind planners that, like poker players and baseball pitchers, they develop their own “tells” and tendencies, and, by identifying these and then varying their plans, they can successfully catch their opponent off guard.\n",

The episode reveals the continued British expertise in deception that significantly enabled the Allied victory in the west. Gregory Hospodor extends this analysis to subsequent campaigns in the Mediterranean, demonstrating how an elaborate, theater level deception enabled construction of a fictitious order of battle that far exceeded in scale the forces actually available, forcing the Axis powers to distribute forces all along their threatened shore and ensuring that a strong landing at any one point had a much better chance of success. While the famous, if macabre, efforts of “The Man That Never Was,” inspired books and motion pictures, Hospodor reminds us that it succeeded only because it was part of a layered, detailed, and well-coordinated deception campaign that continually evolved to maintain a position of relative advantage for the western Allies.\n",

      "\tAlan Donohue shifts our focus to the Eastern Front to one of the most significant theaters of ground combat in World War II. By successfully reinforcing Soviet perceptions that Moscow remained the focus of German attacks in 1942, Operation KREML facilitated a German drive that extended well into the Caucasus and might have cut off Soviet oil supplies had Hitler not become first distracted by, and later obsessed with the city of Stalingrad. Kyle Vautrinot’s analysis of that detailed operation demonstrates that tactical, operational and strategic deception played an important role in the counterattack that rescued the city and destroyed Germany’s offensive capability for the remainder of the war. Soviet deception, known as maskirovka, continued to evolve through the remainder of the war, most significantly, as Curt King points out, in Operation BAGRATION, when successive, and overlapping deception operations kept the Germans constantly off guard and unable to respond to sequential Soviet thrusts, resulting in the destruction of the German Army Group Center and the liberation of Soviet territory taken by the Germans in 1941. But Scott Farquhar’s analysis of the D-Day deception plans reveals that the Soviets were not the only masters of deception in the Second World War. By 1944, the Allies had developed the staff and, most importantly, the expertise, to successfully execute an intricate and large-scale campaign that ensured the safety of the Normandy landings and the following breakout and liberation of France. During the course of the war, Germany went from deceiver to deceived, largely as a result of deficiencies in its intelligence apparatus and vulnerability through codebreaking, demonstrating the importance of superiority in the information domain to enable ground combat.\n",

      "Paragraph ID: 6:\n",
      "\tWhen the American Expeditionary Forces’ (AEF) First Army attacked the St. Mihiel salient in September 1918, it was, by a wide margin, the largest American battle in US military history to date, with over 500,000 Americans engaged in the offensive, along with over 100,000 Frenchmen, and even a number of British and Italian airmen. The offensive also served as the inauguration of large-scale modern warfare for the US Army, with over three thousand artillery pieces firing, more than a thousand aircraft and hundreds of tanks engaged, all supported by vast electronic and electrical networks of communications and intelligence gathering systems. While these facts suggest that General John J. Pershing and his key staff  officers and military planners—to include Major General James W. McAndrew, Brigadier General Fox Conner, and Colonel Arthur L. Conger—were dealing with many new elements of warfare, they were wise enough to incorporate the ancient element of deception into this massive, high-tech, multi-domain operation.\n",

      "\tUnwilling to rely solely on the routine yet essential elements of operational security to obscure the enemy’s understanding of the upcoming attack, they created an elaborate scheme to convince the German Army that the next American offensive might occur not along the St. Mihiel salient, where it was expected, but some 150 miles to the south, emanating from the area around the town of Belfort near the Swiss border and driving towards the German held town of Mulhouse. The deception campaign, often referred to as the “Belfort Ruse,” was an important part of the American plan to keep the Germans guessing as to when and where the next American attack would occur in the fall of 1918. While it is difficult to assess the exact degree to which the Belfort Ruse confused the German Army, the evidence is clear that, in the end, the German Army was not prepared for the Allied attack that struck at both sides of the St. Mihiel salient on 12 September. While the Germans knew that an attack was likely somewhere along the salient, they were unable to predict its size, scope, or timing. Nor could they afford to discount the possibility of an attack in the Belfort-Mulhouse sector, and therefore had to augment their forces there. This\n",

The Germans gained more than 3,000 square kilometers of terrain, inflicted 250,000 casualties on the Allies, and captured a thousand artillery pieces. Within a couple of weeks, the Allies had contained Operation MICHAEL, but at a great cost. In April, the Germans struck the British again, this time near Ypres, Belgium, and they achieved impressive tactical results for the second time in as many months. If anyone doubted whether the Germans had discovered some important solutions to the tactical challenges of the Western Front, their third spring offensive must have settled the case. On 27 May the Germans crashed through the French positions along the Chemin des Dames between Soissons and Reims. By the end of the first day the leading German units had driven south more than a dozen miles from their jump-off positions, making it the most successful attack of the war on the Western Front since 1914. Finally, in early June, the German offensive began to stall, due to the exhaustion of their attacking units, the determination of French reinforcements, and some timely assistance from the soldiers and marines from the American 3rd and 2nd Infantry Divisions at Château-Thierry and Lucy-le-Bocage (near Belleau Wood).\n",

      "\tOne of the keys to the German Army’s tactical successes in 1918 was its ability to catch the Allies unprepared at the point of each attack. The Germans achieved surprise by employing a number of new tactics and techniques all designed to obscure their intentions until the last possible minute. These included employing new “scientific firing” methods that eliminated the need for extensive artillery registration firing, while at the same time dispensing with the days-long (and even occasionally weeks-long) preliminary artillery bombardments. According to historian David Zabecki, the German spring offensives also “included a number of well-planned and intricate deception operations” which were “extensive and elaborate,” and contributed to the surprise they achieved in March, April, and May.\n",

Between 1 March and 1 June more than 400,000 Americans had landed in France, and the pace of arrival was increasing. Realizing that a clock was ticking—soon so many American soldiers and marines would be on the Western Front that a decisive German victory would be inconceivable—the Germans rushed their fourth offensive, in June, against the French lines in Picardy. While they achieved some minor tactical success, the ground gained was much less impressive, and the attack had to be ended more quickly.\n",

This massive attack, which struck along a front of over 70 miles on both sides of Reims, is often considered to be the beginning of what became known as the Second Battle of the Marne. While the Germans achieved some minor successes west of Reims, the attack met abject defeat east of Reims, due in large part to having not achieved the same degree of surprise they had in the first three spring offensives. In fact, the Allies not only discovered where the Germans were going to attack, but exactly when the offensive was going to begin. This critical information gave the Allies the chance to make important defensive adjustments, such as preparing a deep defensive organization and planning a smothering counter-barrage that struck the German front lines just when they were packed with assault troops, both of which helped make the fifth German offensive the least successful of all the major German attacks of 1918.\n",

      "\tEven before the Germans struck along the Marne, the presence of fresh American troops (and the promise of many hundreds of thousands more) along with an awareness that the recent German advances had placed them in vulnerable tactical positions, encouraged General Ferdinand Foch, the recently appointed Allied commander-in-chief, to direct the French and American forces to prepare a counter-attack in mid-July aimed at the northern shoulder of the great salient created by Germany’s third offensive (sometimes called the Aisne-Marne salient, after the major rivers in the region). However, when the Germans attacked first along the Marne, the Commander of the French Army, General Philippe Pétain, wanted to call off the Franco-American counterattack being prepared by the French Tenth Army near Soissons so he could focus on crushing the German assault. Foch rightly sensed that the moment was perfect for an Allied counterattack that would change the momentum of the war. Basing the attack on surprise more than any other factor, the French and American divisions employed tanks, rolling barrages, and a remarkable degree of élan to shatter the German lines and force a German withdrawal from the entire Aisne-Marne salient.\n",

In those three months the Germans experienced the failure of their massive Marne offensive, the shocking Allied successes at Soissons and Amiens, and perhaps most significantly, the arrival of more than 800,000 more American soldiers onto French soil. The only questions remaining were whether the fresh, but partially trained and largely inexperienced, American forces would be able to form a competent field army, and when and where the new American units would strike.

On 24 July, Pershing issued an order creating the First Army, to take effect on 10 August, with headquarters at La Ferté-sous-Jouarre, 40 miles east of Paris, and with himself in personal command, while still holding the position of Commander-in-Chief of the AEF as a whole. By 9 August the Allies had agreed that the new First Army should make a major attack in the Woëvre region, which included the St. Mihiel salient, and that it should be ready to strike in early September. Pershing moved his headquarters to Neufchâteau by 16 August (then subsequently to Ligny-en-Barrois), and the First Army staff began developing detailed plans for the first major American-led offensive of the war. Assembling the massive First Army proved to be a substantial challenge, especially stationing the constituent army corps and divisions along the front lines of the salient without making it obvious to the defending Germans that the next great Allied attack would come in that sector.\n",

After a final argument between Foch and Pershing that nearly led to the cancellation of the St. Mihiel offensive altogether (and according to Pershing’s account, nearly to a physical altercation between the two senior commanders as well!), Marshall was finally able to develop a relatively final plan that involved more than a dozen American divisions assigned\n",

Pershing did not receive Foch’s final official instructions to make preparations for the St. Mihiel offensive until 10 August. Colonel Hugh A. Drum, the newly appointed First Army chief of staff, did not issue his formal instructions to the GHQ and First Army staffs to begin detailed planning until 13 August. But already by 17 August officers on Petain’s headquarters staff—which had administrative control of the new American First Army—were so concerned about the widespread information leaks and general lack of operational security that it told its American liaison officer, Colonel Paul H. Clark, that Pershing needed to be notified of the security problems. Soon after this, the chief of the American mission at Foch’s headquarters, Colonel T. Bentley Mott, informed Fox Conner at First Army HQ that “I have heard it repeatedly stated about these headquarters that ‘everybody was talking of a projected attack in the Woevre’…One officer said, ‘I heard in Paris that the Americans were going to make an attack in the Woevre with 14 divisions.’” In time, even young American soldiers noticed the lack of secrecy. Elmer Sherwood, a member of the 42nd Division that was soon to participate in the attack, wrote in his diary that “it seems to me everybody in France surmises that we are going to fight to flatten the St. Mihiel salient.

In Alsace the lines ran due south through the hills and woods of the Vosges mountains for dozens of miles. Then, from the southern edge of the Vosges the front lines ran through a flat, open stretch of country for nearly 20 miles before entering the foothills of the Jural Alps along the Swiss border. This twenty mile section of flat terrain, approximately 150 miles southeast from the St Mihiel salient, was one of the historic invasion routes between France and Germany, and it was known as the Belfort Gap. In 1918, it had been an inactive sector since the end of the war’s opening campaigns. But it was flat enough and wide enough to conduct division and even corps-sized operations. Pershing’s staff selected it as the site of the diversion effort for just these reasons.\n",

He noted that “at the present time” any potential difficulties due to “streams, lakes, ponds and wet marshy ground, are reduced to a minimum.” He insisted that “now is a most propitious time for launching an attack in this region. The country is now as dry perhaps as it ever gets, the enemy is weak and conditions otherwise favorable for a surprise attack that would, in my opinion, attain the desired objectives and offer opportunities for an exploitation, to the north, of the success gained.” He did report that “the most serious difficulty to be encountered is believed to consist of the large quantities of wire, existing in ‘No Man’s Land’,” along with “the enemy’s defensive organization.” To overcome these, the attacking force would “require the employment of either a large quantity of artillery or of tanks and artillery in smaller quantity but still sufficient to support the advancing infantry.”\n",

After noting that “as to the results of this reconnaissance work on the enemy’s plans, I believe, from all sources, that he is now fully acquainted with all that has been done here,” he added that “I do not believe, however, that the enemy takes this reconnaissance very seriously; he has too good a check on every car load and truck load of ammunition and supplies brought into Belfort to be deceived by any mere paper work demonstration or reconnaissance of officers unaccompanied by actual preparations of guns, munition, materiel and subsistence.”\n",

In part this was because the Allies added other, more real components, to the deception campaign, including more artillery registration in the sector, increased air activity, and heavier radio traffic. Allied units in the front lines increased their raiding activities, most notably the American 29th Division, which conducted violent raids on 31 August and 7 September. Conger himself directly contributed to the deception by intentionally providing false information to the German spy network in the area. In one case, he used a “perfectly fresh sheet of carbon paper” when he wrote Pershing a report from his hotel room describing Bundy’s attack plans. After making sure the carbon paper “was perfectly legible” he crumpled it up, threw it in his waste basket, and took a short walk around the hotel. When he returned to his room, the carbon paper had disappeared.\n",

      "\tWhile senior German commanders—from General Georg Fuchs who commanded all German forces in the St. Mihiel salient (called Army Detachment C), to the local army group commander, General Max von Gallwitz, all the way to the de facto head of the German Army, General Erich Ludendorff—all suspected a Franco-American attack somewhere near the St. Mihiel salient, they proved unable to determine exactly where the attack would hit, how large it would be, what its goals were, or when it would come. Part of this confusion came naturally from the fact that, while many American officers (and no doubt many French soldiers and civilians too) might have openly discussed their thoughts about the next American attack, the American First Army was constantly adjusting the actual details of the offensive, and the Allied High Command even debated whether the attack should be made at all. As late as 31 August Foch made certain strategic proposals to Pershing that could have led to the complete cancellation of the attack at St. Mihiel. Finally on 2 September Foch, Pétain, and Pershing resolved their disagreements and re-authorized a slightly scaled down offensive along the salient. The new plan still involved a huge collection of American and French resources, as well as British and Italian bombers. When the American planners learned that important French heavy artillery assets could not arrive in time, they slipped the start of the offensive to 12 September. Conner promptly informed Bundy that the start of his phantom attack had to be postponed, and that he should spend the extra time expanding his attack plans—widening the potential frontage and going into greater detail about the depth of the advance, even to the point of selecting “the bridgeheads on the Rhine which it would be advantageous to secure.”\n",

      "\tNevertheless, Fuchs and Gallwitz increasingly suspected an attack on the south face of the salient, speculated whether an attack would also come from the western face, and regularly discussed with Ludendorff  how and even whether to meet an attack. They even considered launching a spoiling attack on the southern face of the salient, but ultimately dismissed this option due to a lack of available resources to pull it off. While it is not possible to know for sure, it is possible, perhaps even likely, that one of the reasons that Fuchs did not receive the resources required to conduct the spoiling attack was because the German High Command had to spread its declining reserve forces to other threatened sectors along the Western Front. And in early September, that included the Belfort Gap.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paragraph ID: 2:\n",
      "\tDespite Conger’s doubts of the efficacy of the ruse, the Germans were not only well aware of the American activities around Belfort, they were concerned enough about the possibility of a real attack there that they undertook substantial defensive measures. Diplomats in Switzerland reported “great activity” across the German border, including evacuation of entire villages (they prepared the entire city of Mulhouse for evacuation), the filling up of munitions depots with ammunition and Austrian artillery, the reinforcing of Rhineland fortresses with new, longer-range artillery, and the construction of a “complex system of trenches…between the Ill and Rhine rivers.” Finally, and most significantly, the Germans moved three precious divisions into the area around Mulhouse to meet a possible attack through the Belfort Gap. After the armistice, Conger reported meeting a German colonel who had been a staff officer charged with tracking the American activities near Belfort. According to Conger, this German colonel notified Ludendorff of the need to send reinforcements to the Mulhouse sector, and in his recommendation he stated, “I recognize quite fully that all these preparations being made for attack may perfectly well turn out to be a ruse de guerre intended to mislead us as to the real point of the attack. However, there is nothing to indicate that it is not the real point of attack and our danger there is so great that I deem it imperative to have these divisions.” No doubt, Fuchs would have preferred to have had those divisions available for the direct defense of the salient, and their relocation away from the sector of the actual attack is the clearest sign that the Belfort Ruse bore at least some fruit.\n",

The First Army liberated some two hundred square miles of French territory that had been occupied by the Germans for nearly four years, capturing more than 15,000 enemy soldiers, over 400 artillery pieces, as well as massive stocks of other military supplies, at the cost of just 7,000 American casualties. Most significantly, the offensive frustrated German plans to remove the entire French male population from the salient and to methodically destroy every village, road, railroad, bridge, and well in the salient. It was an extraordinary victory for a brand new field army filled with partially trained officers and men, as well as a number of whole divisions that had never seen combat before. It also served as a welcome introduction to the methods of deception more familiar to European warfare, but practiced less-often by Americans. Many factors contributed to this remarkable American victory, and the innovative, and ultimately successful, Belfort Ruse appears to have been one of them.\n",

However, the enduring value of deception operations is the integration of deception efforts into the concept of operations. During World War I in the Palestine Theater, the thorough integration of deception measures into the overall concept of operations played a significant role in the success of two major campaigns—the battles of Beersheba-Third Gaza in 1917 and the 1918 Megiddo offensive.\n",

This is because offensives required massive concentrations of supplies and troops—so much so, that adversaries generally knew when the opposing army was preparing for an offensive. Thus, the point of deception operations prior to an offensive was not to disguise preparations entirely, but to prevent the enemy from accurately estimating the precise timing, scale, and location of an offensive.\n",

      "\tAt both Beersheba and Megiddo, British deception planners sought to strengthen their adversaries’ inaccurate assumptions about the location of upcoming British offensives. They deliberately intended to make enemy leaders more certain of their (incorrect) assessment of the situation. To employ these measures effectively, deception planners must have an accurate understanding of the adversary’s expectations and situational awareness. In these two cases, British intelligence officers understood enough about the enemy to know where the Turks and Germans believed the next offensive would occur. These insights proved vital in developing effective deception plans that British commanders fully integrated into the concept of operations and scheme of maneuver.\n",

Contingents from across the British Empire—Australians, New Zealanders, and Indians—soon joined the British forces in the Middle East. In 1915, Britain suffered a series of setbacks; the amphibious landings at Gallipoli, designed to force the Dardanelles, failed and the British offensive in Mesopotamia also stalled. To make matters worse, Turkish forces drove from Palestine into the Sinai Peninsula, threatening British-occupied Egypt. The return of British troops from Gallipoli allowed Britain to strike back in the Sinai.

Turkish General Mustafa Kemal—the future founder of the Republic of Turkey—led Seventh Army until Mustafa Fevzi took command in early October. At the time of the British offensive, Seventh Army had only just taken responsibility for the inland sector of the front stretching from Tel el Sheria in the center to Beersheba in the east. The Turkish Eighth Army, commanded by German General Friedrich Kress von Kressenstein, held the coastal sector between Tel el Sheria and Gaza. Eighth Army consisted of three corps: XXII Corps covered the Gaza sector, XX Corps held the center, and III Corps held Beersheba, which anchored the Turks’ left flank in the Negev Desert.

The Turks were certain to capture the haversack and analyze its contents. These contents included fake planning documents indicating that the British planned to attack Gaza by land and sea. Meanwhile, the fake documents claimed, a feint would be launched against Beersheba. Opposing forces frequently captured enemy documents during raids and patrols, so the fact that the haversack seemingly contained important documents was not out of the ordinary. The idea for this ploy is often mistakenly attributed to a single British intelligence officer, MAJ Richard Meinertzhagen, who later claimed that the ruse was the key in deceiving Turkish forces. Instead, the haversack ruse formed only one part of the overall deception plan. British deception planners did not rely on a singular, “brilliant” ruse, but on the cumulative effects of multiple deception ploys that all reinforced the same message, demonstrating the high level of coordination required in any successful deception plan.\n",

To counter this advantage, British troops increased their air defense capabilities by building additional machine gun positions, and Allenby received additional aircraft sufficient for two air wings of 72 aircraft. Allenby sent many to the Beersheba sector, where they flew counter-reconnaissance missions. In addition to attempting to blind enemy air reconnaissance, British planners slowly increased the number of patrols in the Beersheba sector so that the Turks grew accustomed to seeing increased British activity in the area well before the offensive began.\n",

During the day, they camouflaged the railroad and pipeline to prevent observation from the air. To further disguise the deployment, troops marched in stages from one concealed position to another and did so only at night. Ultimately, Turkish and German forces discovered the movement of additional British forces to the Beersheba sector, but they incorrectly assessed the size of the force, believing it contained a maximum of two divisions—one infantry and one mounted—due to the logistical difficulties of moving and supplying forces in the interior.\n",

He also deployed the bulk of his reserves and reinforcements in the Gaza and central sectors of the line. Only one brigade reinforced Beersheba, which suggests that he believed that the main British attack would be against Gaza. His superior, von Falkenhayn, approved these troop dispositions. This meant that the Turks had only one infantry and one cavalry division holding Beersheba. On 29 October, only two days before the offensive began, a message from the Turkish High Command noted that “an outflanking movement on Beersheba, with about one infantry and one cavalry division, is indicated; but the main attack, as before, must be expected on the Gaza front.” Senior German and Turkish commanders in theater did not take any concrete actions to suggest that they expected the British main effort to strike Beersheba.\n",

      "\tBetween winter 1917 and spring 1918, Allenby ordered limited attacks into the Jordan Valley that proved inconclusive, but still intended to mount a major offensive in the fall. In the summer of 1918, Allenby’s troop dispositions included XXI Corps with four divisions in the west, while XX Corps and its three divisions occupied the Samaria Hills in the center. Reinforcements arrived for the Desert Mounted Corps, bringing their strength to four mounted divisions. Allenby placed three divisions on the eastern flank in the Jordan Valley but kept the fourth in reserve near the coast. On the other side, the Turkish Eighth Army held the coastal sector, with the Asia Korps to their left, while Seventh Army dug into the Samaria Hills, and Fourth Army deployed in the Jordan Valley to the east. These units also had a new commander— German General Otto Liman von Sanders.\n",

      "\tThe original plan for the Megiddo offensive—named for the ruins of an ancient city that lay along the planned British avenue of approach— was cautious, but in late August 1918 Allenby selected a more audacious option. The main effort occurred on Allenby’s left, near the Mediterranean coast, where XXI Corps hoped to break through the Turkish lines before wheeling east and advancing on Sebustiye and Nablus. This would create space for the Desert Mounted Corps to ride through the breach and seize Afule before turning east to strike Beisan, thus cutting the Turkish lines of retreat out of the Jordan Valley and, hopefully, trapping the Turkish army. It was essentially the opposite of the third Gaza-Beersheba plan; this time, the main attack struck the Turks on the coastal flank rather than the inland one.\n",

      "\tIn the center, XX Corps used two infantry divisions to fix the Germans and Turks north of Ramallah. On the right, a mounted division, an Indian infantry brigade, and four infantry battalions formed a makeshift element named “Chaytor’s Force” after the commanding officer. They served as a diversion, meant to convince the Turks that the main offensive would come across the Jordan River toward Amman.\n",

      "\tAs at Beersheba, Allenby’s staff prepared a thorough deception plan and fully integrated it into the maneuver plan, in order to strengthen their enemy’s preexisting beliefs as to the location of the next offensive. British intelligence knew from captured documents and prisoners that the Turks and Germans expected a British offensive and believed it would target the Jordan Valley. Turkish intelligence officers had come to this conclusion based on the pattern of British activity throughout 1918, including the British capture of Jericho in February. Throughout the spring, Arab irregular forces under Prince Feisal and British LTC T.E. Lawrence, the famed “Lawrence of Arabia,” conducted raids behind Turkish lines. The Desert Mounted Corps also made two limited incursions into the Jordan Valley, which further reinforced the Turkish perception of a British attack there. Consequently, the Megiddo deception plan had two objectives: strengthen the enemy’s belief that the next offensive consisted of a main attack in the Jordan Valley toward Amman rather than in the west along the Mediterranean coast; and, if possible, convince the Turks and Germans to deploy additional forces in the Jordan Valley.\n",

These rumors included scheduling a fake horse race in Jaffa for 19 September—the planned day of the offensive. A morale event such as a horse race suggested to the Turks and Germans that the British had not planned a major operation near the coast (where Jaffa is located). The date of the fake horse race also served to conceal the timing of the offensive. Deception planners also arranged for British forces to take over one of the most luxurious hotels in Jerusalem.

Allenby had used his mounted forces as his main strike force ever since the breakthrough at Beersheba. Turkish and German intelligence officers believed that wherever the mounted troops went, an attack would follow. The British therefore had to ensure that their adversaries continued to believe that the Desert Mounted Corps remained in the Jordan Valley. This also meant that the British had to prevent enemy intelligence from identifying the Desert Mounted Corps’ true location after it redeployed toward the coast, and used several measures to keep the move hidden.\n",

These troops erected fake encampments with dummy horses made from blankets and wood. They built a total of 15,000 dummy horses, along with dummy straw men to populate the camps. During the day, the men used mules to pull sleds that kicked up large clouds of dust—enough dust to simulate a corps-level cavalry concentration and to obscure the fact that only a division remained. At night, they lit extra camp fires indicative of a much larger force. Meanwhile, the detachment of radio operators remained behind to continue sending the usual message traffic as if the headquarters had never moved.\n",

Several deceptions that supported the first objective also supported the second. The Jerusalem hotel rumor, fake radio transmissions, and dummy camps suggested a Desert Mounted Corps attack in the Jordan Valley and hoped to convince the Turks to deploy more troops there. In addition to these deceptions, two infantry battalions from Chaytor’s Force simulated the arrival of reinforcements. Engineers constructed several new camps along the Jerusalem-Jericho Road. Upon completion, the infantry marched to the camp in daylight, then departed in trucks after nightfall. The following day, the infantry marched to another camp and repeated the process. The movements intended to make the Turks think that the British were busily reinforcing the inland sector, drawing additional Turkish forces in that direction. British planners believed that if they strengthened their positions, Turkish and German commanders would follow suit.\n",

Along the 20-kilometer front planned for the breakthrough, Allenby massed 35,000 infantry, 9,000 cavalry, and 400 artillery pieces against an entrenched Turkish force of 10,000 infantry and 120 cannons. By mid-morning, British infantry completely overran the front-line Turkish defenses, capturing over 7,000 men in the process.\n",

On 20 September, one cavalry division advanced 70 miles—an unheard-of distance by First World War standards. On the 21st, the Australian Mounted Division captured Jenin after advancing 11 miles in less than an hour and a half. The speed stunned the Turkish and German forces, leaving them with little situational awareness and even less time to react. The Yildirim Army Group commander, General Liman von Sanders, did not even realize the extent of British success until over 24 hours into the offensive. Turkish and German commanders not only had the wrong idea of what the British intended to do, but also found it difficult to learn what the British were actually doing. British pre-battle deceptions as well as the speed and ferocity of the offensive created confusion among enemy commanders.\n",

      "\tThe momentum of the breakthrough carried Allenby’s troops forward for over a month. British forces seized Damascus on 30 September, Beirut on 8 October, and Aleppo on 25 October. In addition to the territorial gains, the British captured 75,000 Turkish soldiers over the course of the campaign. These defeats convinced the Turks to sign an armistice at the city of Mudros on 30 October 1918, which effectively ended the war between the Entente powers and Turkey. Germany continued fighting in Europe for only a few more days, until the 11 November 1918 armistice.\n",

      "\tSome evidence suggests that Turkish and German commanders anticipated an attack along the coast. For example, the Turks had concentrated most of their heavy artillery in the western sector. Three out of six heavy artillery battalions supported Eighth Army near the coast. On the surface, this troop disposition indicates General Liman von Sanders knew or at least anticipated where the British offensive would come. But there are other explanations. For example, the terrain in the Samaria Hills and the Jordan Valley were well-suited to defensive operations, whereas the flat, open ground near the coast was not. Rather than having identified the location of the offensive, it is more likely that Liman deployed more artillery near the coast to compensate for the lack of defensible terrain.\n",

The templated presence of an infantry division suggests that the ruse of infantry reinforcements arriving in camps during the day and being trucked out at night also succeeded. However, German and Turkish intelligence had accurately assessed that a British cavalry division was stationed in reserve near the coast. This intelligence picture suggests that the British had successfully prevented the Desert Mounted Corps’ redeployment from being discovered. Turkish and German commanders did not know that Allenby’s strike force moved to the other end of the line. British planners had achieved their first objective of ensuring that the enemy continued to believe that the main offensive intended to strike the Jordan Valley.\n",

      "\tFurthermore, the deployment patterns of Turkish and German reinforcements suggest that the British achieved their second objective of drawing enemy forces into the Jordan Valley. Between March and September, most reinforcements took position in the eastern and central sectors, not to the western sector. In his memoirs, Liman notes that he sent four infantry battalions to Fourth Army in the Jordan Valley, while assigning an additional four battalions arriving in September to the Seventh Army, in the center. When the 2nd Caucasian Cavalry Brigade arrived in March, it took a position near the coast, but, by 15 September, relocated to the eastern sector. In August, Liman ordered three German battalions to move from the coast to the center to rejoin the rest of the Asia Korps. He also deployed the Turkish 24th Division on the left flank of Seventh Army, where the Samaria Hills descend into the Jordan Valley. These decisions suggest that Liman believed that he needed to reinforce his eastern flank.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paragraph ID: 3:\n",
      "\tAnother event just two days prior to the offensive further emphasized the importance that Liman placed on protecting the eastern flank. On 17 September, Turkish troops captured a deserter from one of Britain’s Indian units. The deserter informed his captors that the British planned to attack near the coast. Upon receiving this report, Turkish Eighth Army commander Ҫevat Pasha asked Liman for permission to withdraw from his forward positions and redeploy on better ground, but Liman refused to authorize a withdrawal.\n",

      "\tThe deserter had alerted the Turks to the possible timing and location of the offensive, but even if Liman believed the deserter’s information, he still did not know if an attack on his western flank would comprise the main effort or a feint. Liman certainly knew that the British had enough forces in theater to launch attacks on both of his flanks. After the war, Liman wrote that he had to expect an attack near the coast, but the more important sectors were further east. “The situation of the Army Group would become critical,” Liman insisted, “if we were beaten on the Jordan, or east of the Jordan.”\n",

Liman was more concerned with the attacks on the railroad than the Indian deserter’s tale, later writing that “I realized at once that these attacks on our only line of communications were the beginning of serious fighting.” Liman was correct that serious fighting had begun, but he had focused on the wrong flank.\n",

The British also built multiple deceptions into the plan to further reinforce the Turks’ and Germans’ incorrect assessments. Most importantly, military deception was not merely an afterthought or a just a simple addition to an existing plan. Rather, British planners fully integrated the deception plan into the concept of operations and scheme of maneuver, coordinating all preparations for the offensives, and ensuring that British forces did not give away vital information that might allow the enemy to discover British intentions.\n",

      "\tBlitzkrieg. The word immediately elicits thoughts of mobile German combined arms forces returning maneuver to the battlefield during World War II. The Germans perfected this approach against Poland and France. However, this so-called “lighting war” was executed in its most pure form in the campaigns of North Africa, between the German-Italian force of Panzerarmee Afrika (PAA) and the British Eighth Army. The flat terrain and lack of natural obstacles allowed for near perfect command and control in the attack, with the only tactical limiting factor being the top speed of the tanks. Open fields of vision allowed for engagements to occur at maximum ranges, bringing tank and anti-tank guns to the fore in importance on the battlefield. Open flanks to the south led to never ending envelopments being conducted by both sides. Thus, these campaigns witnessed a series of victorious maneuvers followed by long pursuits across the open desert. Both sides traded victories, moving back and forth across the desert, much like two coiled springs attached to each other. While one side lost power as it stretched its lines of communication (LOC) to a breaking point, the other simultaneously increased in power with shortened LOCs. This see-saw warfare of maneuver finally came to an end at the small village of El-Alamein, located only 160 miles west of Cairo. It was here that restrictive terrain to the south forced the adversaries to exchange blitzkrieg for static warfare. Both sides now faced a situation reminiscent of the trenches of World War 1. They had to find a way to break the enemy lines that no longer relied on the “end runs” that had proven so successful in the last two years.

      "\tBeginning on 26 May 1942, PAA, commanded by Field Marshall Erwin Rommel, attacked and defeated the British Eighth Army at the Battle of Gazala, resulting in yet another pursuit east. The Eighth Army withdrew back toward the Egyptian border, losing large quantities of supplies and the port of Tobruk to the advancing Germans. The pursuit continued until the Eighth Army reached El-Alamein, where they established a strong defensive line. Here, the British were able to secure their right flank with the Mediterranean Sea and their left flank with the Qattara Depression (an area in western Egypt that was covered with salt marshes and deep sand dunes which severely limited the mobility of tanks, or any other vehicle). Rommel attempted to break this short, 30-mile line in the south (near the Depression) during the Battle of Alam Halfa from 30 August to 5 September 1942 but difficult terrain, well established British positions and lack of fuel resulted in a German defeat. This tactical defeat greatly attrited the German panzer forces and once again PAA had reached a culminating point. Rommel established defensive positions between the same secure terrain features the British used to stop him. September witnessed the two exhausted armies racing to rebuild themselves and break the static line they had created.\n",

This infusion of equipment (along with much needed personnel reinforcement from Great Britain) allowed the British to reorganize and reequip the X Corps, which contained the majority of the Eighth Army tanks. Second, the British had gained naval and air superiority at this time. The Royal Navy and Air Force were sinking Italian ships and harassing the German ground supply routes at a rate that prevented Rommel from properly rebuilding his forces. The most critical shortage for PAA was the lack of fuel, which directly affected how the Germans deployed their forces in the upcoming battle. The final factor that brought the initiative back to the British Eighth Army was a new commander: Lieutenant General Sir Bernard Law Montgomery. His personality and leadership brought new life to a defeated army. He declared: “We must regard ourselves as having been born for this battle.” He visited all of his units to personally convey this message and then created a plan to implement his vision. This plan, however, would have to overcome a German defensive position, the likes of which had not been previously encountered in these last two years of desert warfare.\n",

      "\tPAA spent September and October of 1942 creating a defense that rivaled their trench systems of World War I in depth and complexity, reaching five miles deep in some areas. Their defense in depth began with almost a half million mines stretching between their secure flanks on the Mediterranean Sea and the Qattara Depression. Behind this almost unimaginable barrier, their main line was a patchwork of both German and Italian infantry units and anti-tank guns that covered these mines. Finally, Rommel placed the panzers of the Afrika Korps, the German portion of PAA, behind the main line as a counter attack force, prepared to defeat any penetration of the main line. While this defense in depth was formidable, it was not as flexible as it could have been. PAA had only enough fuel reserves to move the Afrika Korps once for any possible counterattack scenario. Since Rommel had limited knowledge of the British intent, he was forced to position the 21st Panzer Division in the south and the 15th Panzer Division in the North (each of them also had a less powerful Italian Armored Division co-located). Had the Germans known the direction of the expected Eighth Army attack, they would likely have weighted the appropriate flank with a majority of the Afrika Korps.\n",

British gunners would then destroy the Afrika Korps as it attempted to counter-attack. Finally, the XIII Corps scheduled a demonstration in the south that would appear to be the main attack in order to fix the German southern forces, specifically the 21st Panzer Division, enabling X Corps to defeat the Afrika Korps piecemeal.\n",

      "\tThere was, however, a major problem with the plan. LieutenantColonel Charles Richardson, Eighth Army’s main planner, described LIGHTFOOT’s main attack in the north as, “horribly obvious.” The British would have to mass X Corps and all the supporting artillery and supplies in their assault and firing positions just prior to the attack. Like a poor boxer who telegraphs his punches, German reconnaissance could easily identify this massing in the open desert. Early detection would allow PAA to reposition and reinforce their northern sectors, making a successful breakthrough extremely costly at best. Montgomery, thus, turned to Richardson and Lieutenant Colonel Geoffrey Barkas, the Director of Camouflage at General Headquarters Middle East, to create a deception plan. While the Eighth Army had conducted deception operations in the past, most had been on a small scale, and designed only to misdirect air attacks. Montgomery now envisioned an operation on a much grander scale. The Eighth Army Chief of Staff asked Barkas: “what Camouflage could do to assist the following objects:\n",

Montgomery desired Rommel to believe that the when would be at least two weeks past the actual date of LIGHTFOOT which was scheduled to begin on 23 October. The intent was to lull PAA into a false sense of security. If the Germans did not expect an attack until mid-November, they might be less vigilant on the night of the British assault. Additionally, they might assume that they had more time to build their defenses and thus be less diligent with their October preparations of the battlefield. As for the where, Montgomery wanted the Germans to believe that the attack would come in the south (XIII Corps sector) and force them to commit unnecessary forces there. This second objective was the more resource intensive of the two since that meant somehow concealing the intentions and movement of an entire Corps. Luckily, Barkas had the 85th Camouflage Company from South Africa and three additional pioneer companies attached to create the materials needed to support the operation.\n",

Each SO had to be greatly detailed since widely dispersed units had to execute at different times and support the same illusion of an attack in the south which was to occur in early November. All of these sub-operations had to be stand-alone sentences that, when read together by the PAA intelligence personnel, created a coherent paragraph and thus produced the illusion. If any of these SOs were out of sync with the others, the picture would not make sense. Even the Middle East Command assisted in the illusion by creating background stories supporting an attack in early November. It extended both the Cairo hotel reservations for some high-ranking officers, and a major exercise in the Haifa Staff  College. It announced a fake conference between Generals Alexander and Wavell scheduled for 26 October and developed a program of radio traffic that supported a southern attack. Finally, it barred the Desert Air Force from attacking the enemy defenses on the days immediately prior to the scheduled attack, much to their dismay. They did conduct attacks on the Luftwaffe in October that resulted in the prevention of enemy air reconnaissance over the British attack positions.\n",

      "\tPossibly the most important SO was MARTELLO. Concealing X Corps’ equipment and supplies presented the greatest challenge to the success of BERTRAM. With two corps already forward deployed, X Corps had to be moved close to the front lines just prior to the attack. Finding this corps in its assault positions would tell the Germans the exact timing and location of the British main attack. Thus, one of the main problems the Eighth Army had to solve was how to hide it all. Luckily, Lieutenant Colonel Barkas had been developing techniques on how to conceal vehicles in an open desert for the last two years. Obviously, without any foliage, standard camouflage was not an option. In fact, the standard camouflage covering used effectively in Europe to break up the silhouettes of the UK vehicles failed in North Africa. The covering made the artillery and vehicles stand out more, giving the enemy an easier target for their artillery and aircraft. Therefore, the objective was not to hide the vehicles, but to make them look like something other than what they were. A brain child of General Wavell (the Middle East Commander in 1940-41), the British had developed a device called the “Sunshield.” Sunshields could either make a truck look like a tank (presenting the illusion of strength) or in the case of those used in Operation BERTRAM, to make tanks look like trucks, thus presenting an illusion of weakness (see Figure 3.3).

British forces deployed it in early October so that the Germans became conditioned to its existence and did not suspect that it was part of the build-up for an imminent attack. After the war, Barkas recalled, “In this way the enemy would become accustomed to seeing it and, when nothing further seemed to happen, might be expected to relax his vigilance.”\n",

The only supplies not covered up by this scheme were the fuel that X Corps needed. Luckily for the British, El-Alamein Station held a number of preexisting slit trenches. Logisticians realized that they could conceal hundreds of 4-gallon cans of fuel along the masonry walls of these slit trenches (basically just “thickening” the walls). Several tests with their own reconnaissance aircraft proved that the shadows of the trench naturally covered the fuel, allowing 2,000 tons of fuel to be hidden in plain sight.\n",

One of the most recognizable vehicles in theater, for either side, was the British 25-Pounder Field Gun and its associated prime mover, known as a “Quad.” Each 25-pounder had a limber in between the prime mover and the piece (reminiscent of horse drawn artillery) that gave it a highly distinctive profile. Air reconnaissance could positively spot these vehicles from great distances and, since large artillery concentrations were yet another positive indicator of an upcoming attack, planners needed to conceal them as something other than artillery. CANNIBAL1 became yet another ingenious deception. It broke the Quads away from the limber and covered them with canvas tarpaulins, making them look like ordinary 3-ton supply trucks (see Figure 3.4). Similarly, the disconnected 25-Pounders and their limbers also received a similar tarpaulin to represent even more trucks. As with Martello, the 360 guns of CANNIBAL 1 stood motionless for a month, taking away any suspicion that this was a buildup of an upcoming attack in the north.\n",

Like CANNIBAL, SO MUNASSIB was designed to hide “artillery.” But this effort was even more complicated and took the deception effort to the next level of trickery. The British established three regiments of dummy artillery in assault positions but poorly camouflaged them. They allowed the covers to deteriorate over time, facilitating German identification of the dummy positions and indicating a British attack in the north. However, MARTELLO was actually a “double-bluff” designed for use when the actual attack came. Once the attack started in the north, artillerists replaced the dummy guns with real ones (see figures 3. and 3.5) making the Germans think the dummy gun positions had been created to conceal a main attack in the south.\n",

At night, the same crews pulled up the “pipeline” and displaced it forward, alongside the next length of trench. Finally, they filled the open trench just prior to sunrise, presenting the illusion of a newly-buried pipeline. As a final touch, work crews added dummy pumping stations and reservoirs for realism. This effort not only indicated that the Eighth Army was preparing to support a major effort in the south, but also assisted in the timing deception. The British rate of construction indicated that the pipeline could not possibly be completed until the beginning of November. SO BRIAN was a reverse of MARTELLO.

At MARTELLO, each tank occupied a designated and pre-identified sunshield. To further conceal the movement, crews wiped away the tracks that they made exiting and entering the two areas. Complementing the effort in another domain, false radio traffic completed the ruse that X Corps remained in the south. Finally, the artillery from CANNIBAL 1 moved at night to their firing positions in CANNIBAL 2, but remained concealed as 3-ton trucks. Thus, the British positioned their main effort, XXX Corps and X Corps in areas that the Germans (hopefully) had ignored for the last month. Montgomery had successfully placed the vast strength of the Eighth Army in position to attack in the north, while erecting a vast phony army to bluff the Germans in the south.\n",

      "\tDuring early July 1943, German and Italian forces across the Mediterranean theater awaited the inevitable Allied follow-up to the Axis catastrophe in Tunisia. The critical problem was determining where the blow would fall. The seizure of the Italian islands of Pantelleria, Lampedusa, Linosa, and Lampione during early June as well as geo-strategic common sense suggested strongly that invading Sicily was the next logical Allied move. Yet when the assault on Sicily, codenamed HUSKY, occurred on 10 July 1943, an Italian garrison with only two reinforcing German divisions—15. Panzergrenadier-Division and Fallschirm-Panzer-Division Nr. Hermann Göring—stood ready to respond to the 180,000 men of the Allied assault echelon.\n",

      "\tThe invasion was no cakewalk, but it could have been much worse. Italian losses in North Africa and faltering morale meant that German units would be the primary bulwark of any defense. Between 9 March and 10 July, Oberkommando der Wehrmacht, the German military high command (OKW), sent one division to Sardinia and one to Corsica. The Balkans saw the number of German divisions rise from eight to eighteen. Greece received the most attention; seven German divisions joined the normal garrison of one. Had OKW correctly divined Allied intentions and prioritized Sicily, the result of the invasion clearly might have been different.\n",

The simplest answer, although by no means the only one, is that the Allies deceived Axis leaders as to their intentions, which caused the Germans to misallocate the increasingly scarce resources of the Wehrmacht, the only forces truly capable of responding effectively to an Allied incursion by this point of the war. This, then, is the story of Operation BARCLAY, the Allied deception plan for the Mediterranean in 1943. BARCLAY, which included many subsidiary lines of effort, such as Operation MINCEMEAT that aimed to mislead the enemy as to Allied plans through so-called special means and Operation CASCADE, a comprehensive order-of-battle deception, played a key role in setting the conditions for the invasion of Sicily to succeed.\n",

Clarke, two officers, and ten enlisted men. Although Clarke would direct thousands in all manner of deception activities, including temporarily assigned regular army units, the core of “A” Force was never more than a few hundred men. Even within these few, security demanded that only a handful were ever “in the know” about the entire scope of “A” Force’s undertakings. As the scale of “A” Force’s efforts and resources expanded, its organization changed: Control dealt with plans, policy, and administration; Operations handled physical employment and tactical deception in the field; and Intelligence directed deception schemes through channels controlled by intelligence or security authorities.\n",

Indeed, historian Michael Howard has described this complex region as “an intelligence officer’s paradise and a security officer’s hell.” The area contained almost limitless conduits through which to collect information and to transmit disinformation, and this situation worked both ways. Thus, months of assiduous effort on a deception operation could be compromised easily as it was impossible to discover, detain, eliminate, or turn all enemy agents. Simply put, balancing the scale of deception activity with the vital importance of security was difficult at best in a region where political, familial, and ethnic relationships might extend back a millennia and many did not appreciate the British presence.\n",

Beven, which in December 1942 formally took responsibility for strategic deception in Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and India. Within its realm and subject to the guidance and approval of the Allied Combined Chiefs of Staff, the LCS had nearly unlimited authority for the execution of strategic deception; it was also a super-secret group within the broader intelligence community. Clearly, as the scope of the Western Allies’ military operations increased, the imperative for coordinating strategic efforts across theaters also increased. So, too, did the LCS take measures to continue to build upon the successes of the previous years, providing continuity for as well as coordination across previously disparate sub-organizations and operations. Finally, the LCS coordinated and cooperated with other intelligence and operational organizations to ensure synchronization.\n",

      "Paragraph ID: 2:\n",
      "\tOperation BARCLAY manifested this new degree of coordination and direction in many ways. First, high-level cooperation meant that deceivers had access to ULTRA intelligence; cryptologists broke the Abwehr (German military intelligence service) Enigma (mechanically encoded) cypher at Bletchley Park in December 1941. This intelligence source allowed carefully vetted deceivers unparalleled insight into the Axis intelligence network to determine and play upon fears and expectations and to assess the effectiveness of deception schemes. Second, clear direction from the Combined Chiefs of Staff and the theater commander, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, guaranteed that distinct deception operations, such as MINCEMEAT and CASCADE, all served a common operational purpose. Finally, inter-theater coordination meant that discrete activities dovetailed operationally. Personnel of MI5 Section B1B and Naval Intelligence Division Section 17M were jointly responsible for MINCEMEAT. “A” Force’s Cairo-based, order-of-battle deceivers, responsible for CASCADE, were largely unaware of London-based Section B1B and Section 17M’s existence (although Dudley Clarke was), a fact that did not matter provided there was a coordinating administrative bridge.

Reading the German’s mail made it possible to play upon senior leaders’ fears and expectations. It also made judging the effectiveness of deception activities possible. Competition reigned between Abwehr’s overseas stations. This combined with an absence of close, critical oversight meant that Abwehr operators were often rewarded for the number of agents they recruited and the amount of intelligence they generated no matter how dubious. The result was that Abwehr served as willing, if unknowing or cynical, broadcasters of Allied deception to FHW.\n",

Thereafter, deception planning progressed quickly. The LCS began work on a general framework to achieve the following ends: first, to pose credible threats to the south of France and Balkans; second, to weaken the garrison of Sicily and deter reinforcements, especially German ones; and, finally, to minimize attacks on the shipping assembling for HUSKY. After approval by the Combined Chiefs of Staff, the LCS sent “A” Force its outline plan, which it received on 27 February. “A” Force finalized the BARCLAY plan on 21 March, which received Eisenhower’s approval on 10 April and was issued by the LCS on 24 April.\n",

American forces under Lieutenant General George Patton would take Corsica and Sardinia to cover the main effort against southern France by General Sir Harold Alexander’s forces, British Eighth Army and a French one.

Furthermore, the enemy did not need to believe the Allies were going to invade Greece and France, only that they could and might.

For example, Hitler in particular worried obsessively about the Balkans. “A” Force had already mounted two recent operations, WAREHOUSE and WITHSTAND, to play upon these fears. BARCLAY need only continue in this regard. Furthermore, Abwehr, led by Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, suffered from inefficiency, corruption, and disloyalty. Thus, despite the elaborate German apparatus for intelligence collection and analysis, they were consistently and successfully deceived.

For WATERFALL, deceivers created a gigantic display of fake equipment in Cyrenaica. Over one hundred bogus landing craft, an armored division’s worth of dummy equipment, and enough gliders and aircraft for an airborne division were on full display in harbors, assembly areas, and airfields. This was intended for Axis photoreconnaissance aircraft in the only sector they could reach. The purpose was to fool photo interpreters and intelligence analysts into reporting preparations for an Allied assault against Greece and Crete. MINCEMEAT, discussed in more detail later, aimed to plant suggestions of planned invasions of Corsica and Greece by floating a body bearing fake documents ashore in Spain. Finally, CASCADE, which began in March 1942 and was enlarged several times until replaced by WANTAGE in 1944, comprised a sweeping order-of-battle deception that formed the essential background for BARCLAY’s notional eastern attacks.\n",

By 1944, FHW carried every unit created on its Allied order of battle assessments. Consequently, CASCADE formed a firm foundation upon which a great deal of Allied strategic deception was based. Simply put, BARCLAY would not have succeeded without it. Due in large part to CASCADE, on 10 July 1943, at least seven German divisions awaited an assault that never came hundreds of miles away from their comrades on Sicily. By the time of the landings, the Germans believed that the Allies had 20 more divisions in the Mediterranean theater than they actually did (four armored, fifteen infantry, and one airborne), in addition to two Corps and one Army headquarters.\n",

The pair settled upon submarine delivery as the most effective way of placing the body of Major Martin, and solved the problem of long-term storage and delivery by such a method. Finally, they created the documents Major Martin would carry, the key one being a personal letter from Vice Chief of the Imperial Staff, Lieutenant General Sir Archibald Nye, to General Sir Harold Alexander, Eisenhower’s deputy in the Mediterranean. The letter stated that the Allies were planning a landing in Greece, codenamed HUSKY, and another, codenamed BRIMSTONE, for which a fictional attack on Sicily would serve as a cover story.

Indeed, one is tempted to assert that emphasizing deception during World War II came as almost second nature to them.

For example, MINCEMEAT’s masterminds, Cholmondeley and Montagu, were both “gentlemen.” Montagu was the second son of a baron and attended Cambridge, while Cholmondeley was also from a respectable family and Oxford-educated.

It lacked a true chief of staff and was usually composed of two parts, General (“G”) and Administrative (“Adm”). The effect of this organization was that deception operatives often had direct access to the commander. The American one, on the other hand, revolved around a rigid hierarchy. Assistant chiefs of staff of one of the four primary staff sections—Personnel (“1”), Intelligence (“2”), Operations (“3”), and Supply (“4”)—reported to the chief of staff who in turn reported to the commander. Deceivers, then, had to gain two levels of approval at the very least before a commander ever heard their ideas. The problem with this structure was, in the words of intelligence historian Thaddeus Holt, “that it smothered deception, which of all the activities needs to be imaginative and flexible, under layers of bureaucracy and bureaucratic coordination.”\n",

For example, German forces in Greece remained throughout the HUSKY campaign and briefly gained a new commander, Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel. That this occurred was due to both Allied deception efforts and Hitler’s phobia regarding the Balkans. So, too, was the choice to commit only two German divisions initially to the defense of Sicily warranted by realistic concerns about Italy’s commitment to the war. Should Italy abruptly surrender, which occurred in September, the 60,000 Germans on the island would find themselves dangling at the end of a very long rope.

How this commonly shared overestimation of Allied combat power affected the German military’s understanding of the campaign is little understood, but certainly must have had repercussions. If the Allies did indeed have fifty amphibious-ready divisions in North Africa, the 1947 assessment of Heinrich von Vietinghoff, commander of the German 10. Armee in Italy, that “from the German standpoint it is incomprehensible that the Allies did not seize the straits of Messina. This would have been possible without any special difficulty” makes perfect sense. But, again, the Allies did not.

      "\tThe German Wehrmacht suffered its first major reversal of the Second World War in the depths of European Russia during the winter of 1941-1942. A combination of faulty intelligence, poor logistical planning, inclement weather conditions, and the sheer tenacity of the Red Army brought the German invaders to a shuddering halt along the entire front, nowhere more spectacularly than at the gates of Moscow. The Führer and Supreme Commander of the Wehrmacht, Adolf Hitler, decided in early 1942 that the renewed summer offensive would not be aimed at the Soviet capital city, but instead towards the vitally important, oil-producing regions of the Caucasus region in the south (Operation BLAU). Indeed, Hitler had consistently expressed the opinion that economic factors were of paramount importance to the conduct of modern warfare, but he believed that his generals did not understand this as they were too conservative and devoted to outdated maxims of war that focused solely on the destruction of the enemy’s armed forces. The Wehrmacht, he posited, would now face an insurmountable crisis in terms of operational freedom if it did not seize the Caucasus oil for itself. A further mitigating factor for this plan was that, if successful, it would have the added boon of denying the Soviets their own most important source of oil.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paragraph ID: 7:\n",
      "\tHitler and his top military aides were fully cognizant that losses suffered by the Ostheer (“eastern army”) in 1941 could not be replaced in full, which meant that the offensive in 1942 would only be conducted on one axis (as opposed to three the previous summer). In fact, the Chief of the General Staff, Colonel-General Franz Halder, had suggested that the Army should go over to the defensive for the year in order to rebuild and prepare for the full offensive commitment of all army groups in 1943. This strategy, however, was anathema to Hitler, who was fearful that any respite would allow the Soviets to reconstitute their own armed forces and remain in the war until the Western Allies were in a position to open a second land front on the European mainland. Once Hitler had formulated his own strategy for the coming campaign—a single operation in the south towards the Caucasus oilfields —he would not be disabused of his rationale;\n",

The initial concern now was to try to convince the Soviet political and military leadership that the target of the German summer offensive would be Moscow as opposed to the southern sector. A strategy of deception was initiated under the code name Operation KREML (‘Kremlin’) that eventually came to involve the highest ranking generals and politicians down to frontline troops and individual saboteurs.\n",

In fact, Operation KREML has been described as having had the potential to make it a “masterpiece of this somewhat speculative form of military art.” Most significantly, it had a sound premise in that it advocated a renewal of the offensive against Moscow, which actually made strategic sense given the proximity of German Army Group Center to Moscow as well as the importance of the Soviet capital as a center of administration and industry and as a transportation hub. This was also what Stalin and the Soviet high command ultimately expected. However, though the capture of Moscow would have been especially welcome in terms of military strategy, the destructive impact on the Soviet war economy, and the effect on German morale at home and at the front, it would undoubtedly have been a costly venture: An offensive in this region would effectively have been a frontal assault on the most heavily defended sector of the entire Eastern Front.\n",

      "\tPlanning for KREML was under way almost as soon as it was for BLAU. On 12 February, the chief of the armed forces high command (OKW), Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, issued a directive entitled “Guidelines for Enemy Deception” (Richtlinien für die Feindtäuschung). As part of this undertaking, German counter-intelligence agents were tasked with convincing the Soviets that Moscow and the industrial areas of the middle Volga region would be the primary targets of the renewed German offensive. For example, members of the recently formed Russian Nationalist People’s Army (Russkaia natsional’naia narodnaia armiia, RNNA), comprised of former Red Army prisoners of war, were trained as spies and saboteurs to be transferred to the Soviet rear from the end of May. Among other things, the Gestapo (German secret state police) supplied them with identification papers and passports, military and political documentation to allow access to important locations, and stamps and seals for the majority of the military commissariats and district councils around Moscow. Some of those who returned reported that they had been active not only in Moscow but also as far away as Cheliabinsk, Sverdlovsk (now Ekaterinburg), and other cities. The German authorities also began a campaign to destroy Soviet espionage efforts in Western Europe that summer, which resulted in the arrest of approximately 100 operatives.\n",

      "\tHalder was generally reticent about KREML, even when confiding in his own diary. However, on 3 May, he noted that he had had a meeting with the Deputy Chief of the General Staff (Major-General Günther Blumentritt) about the deception measures being initiated for BLAU. Nine days later, Halder wrote that the Chief of Staff of Army Group Center (Major-General Otto Wöhler) had received instructions that day from both Hitler and himself concerning these plans, but does not go into any further detail. Finally, almost two weeks before BLAU began, he noted that outstanding issues had been discussed with Wöhler, especially with respect to implementing measures for KREML. The plan, he concluded, was straightforward: “Mislead the enemy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Paragraph ID: 3:\n",
      "\tUnsurprisingly, the main focus of concern for the Soviets was their capital city and how to defend it against the likely German offensive. For the month of April, the command of Briansk Front (one of three army groups screening Moscow) decreed that its main priority was to hold the lines it occupied. It further noted that, in strengthening these positions, the main operational areas were to be given special attention, two of which were to be prioritized by the local commanders: The Bolkhov–Belëv sector, and the Orël–Mtsensk axis towards Tula (both approximately 300 km south-west of Moscow). On 5 April, the chief intelligence officer (Ic) of Army Group Center noted that Soviet Western Front (Army General G.K. Zhukov) had apparently transferred 60th Rifle Division to the north-west in order to create a Schwerpunkt (“point of main defense”) on both sides of the road Bolkhov–Belëv. This was exactly where the Germans had ostensibly planned their main advance on Moscow (discussed below).\n",

      "\tThree months after Keitel issued his initial order, his deputy, Colonel-General Alfred Jodl, supplemented it with more specific information on the situation as it stood. Present circumstances, he declared, were favorable for KREML for a number of reasons. Significantly, intentions would be largely hidden from the enemy because deployments for BLAU extended well into the rear area of Army Group Center. There was an east to west movement of troops (which suggested that they were being redeployed away from the southern sector), and a localized regrouping of units in Army Groups South and Center was currently being implemented (which would doubtless add to the enemy’s uncertainty with respect to German intentions). Jodl further noted that there were plans to increase statements\n",

      "\tin military journals and in the foreign press—as well as in the German press to a limited degree—about the significance of Moscow as the focal point of Soviet resistance, its importance as a communications hub, and the fact that it was the center of Soviet armaments production. The general theme of such proclamations was to be that the capture of Moscow would create a breach in the enemy line while at the same time deprive the Soviet leadership of much of its flexibility. The loss of the capital would also deny the Russians the ability to regroup and continue the struggle west of the Volga. From 25 May, Jodl suggested, it would be inevitable that the enemy would have some sort of clarification about German force dispositions. From the end of that month, therefore, it would be especially important to draw Soviet attention away from Army Group South to Army Group Center. It would also be imperative to feign weakness in many sectors of Army Group South by substituting units of the satellite armies for German formations. This would have the added benefit of offering a period of rehabilitation to the troops that would be withdrawn. Even the German soldiers at the front were to be misled into believing that Moscow would be the target of the offensive, and, where possible, intermittent reinforced artillery fire was to be carried out in certain areas. Likewise, the remaining sectors of Army Groups Center and North were to busy themselves with lively reconnaissance and deceptive measures as well as the preparation of local feints in order to conceal the true defensive posture of these positions and to tie down as many enemy units as possible. German units also spread disinformation in radio traffic that was specifically meant to be picked up by Red Army commands.\n",

      "Paragraph ID: 2:\n",
      "\tOn 9 May, an Abwehr (German military intelligence) report based on information gleaned from the Exchange Telegraph news agency in Moscow suggested that Zhukov’s preparations for the anticipated German offensive towards Moscow were “completed”. The same agency also noted around this time that the Soviets had observed large troop movements to the southwest of Moscow in the Briansk–Orël–Kursk area. These, of course, were forces to be used during BLAU, but it was certainly plausible from the Soviet perspective that these enemy formations were concentrating instead for a renewed advance on the capital.\n",

On 6 April, for example, he noted that a number of articles which stated that the capture of the enemy’s capital city was always\n",

He hoped that this would encourage international observers to focus their attention on Moscow—or at the very least the northern sector—instead of on the south, though he admitted that nobody seemed to have fallen for the ruse up to that point. Goebbels later wrote that he would personally send a boisterous news correspondent known to his fellow journalists in the West on a trip to the central sector of the Eastern Front, followed immediately by his reassignment to neutral Portugal, where he was to act drunk and spread rumors about an impending assault on Moscow. Additionally, Goebbels’s diary entry for 20 May reveals a plan whereby an “unauthorized” article had been published in the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper, only to then be unceremoniously withdrawn because it seemingly revealed German intentions to attack the Soviet capital. Though he was not entirely convinced that such endeavors would have a significant impact, he nevertheless noted that “one must always try whatever one can do.” Three days later, he suggested that he was planning to have an article apparently written by the OKW published in Turkey or Portugal about an offensive in the central sector. He admitted, however, that this action had the potential to do more harm than good should the real authors of the article become clear, though again he stressed that “everything possible” had to be done in order to conceal BLAU. Goebbels further noted that Hitler himself had fully approved of these efforts. On the following day, Halder suggested that deceptive measures with respect to BLAU had “worked well” judging by what was being reported in the foreign press. Finally, on 30 May Goebbels noted that Hitler was “very satisfied” with the effects of the reports published by the German journalists abroad. The Führer added that they had done a “very great service” to the conduct of the war.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paragraph ID: 2:\n",
      "\tThese efforts were reinforced to a great degree by Stalin’s own distrustful nature. Around this time, for example, the British had discovered from a “secret and reliable source” that German VIII Fliegerkorps (“Air Corps”) was being transferred from the central sector to the Crimea in the south, which indicated that a German offensive was imminent there. However, he refused to trust the British even when they offered him such highly accurate signals intelligence information (most likely emanating from Ultra, its encryption of top-echelon German communications). Stalin’s dismissal of outsider information that had foretold the initial German invasion of the Soviet Union the previous year (Operation BARBAROSSA) had nearly resulted in defeat; his suspicion of the intentions of the British government would now once again have almost fatal repercussions for his people and armed forces.\n",

Frontline units deliberately allowed some copies to fall into the enemy’s hands in different ways, such as on dead officers or on aircraft that had apparently deviated from their flight paths. The Luftwaffe (air force) carried out aerial reconnaissance on defensive positions in and around Moscow as well as further eastward around the cities of Vladimir, Ivanovo, Tambov, Gor’kii (Nizhnii Novgorod), and Rybinsk. Operatives disseminated false information over the radio and agents increasingly crossed the front lines in this sector. A complete regrouping and transfer of troops and command posts also took place. Army staffs were instructed to develop plans for their operations up to 5 June, while corps headquarters were to have their work completed five days later.

In order to allow the Luftwaffe to stagger its support, 4th Army and 2nd Panzer Army (in the south) would ostensibly begin their operations on “X-Day,” while 3rd Panzer Army (on the left wing) would, according to developments, most likely join battle five days later. On the right flank, 2nd Army was to move on Elets (350 km due south of Moscow), while Army Group North was either to stay on the defensive or, in the case of an enemy withdrawal, to advance with its southern wing towards Peno–Ostashkov. On the northern flank of the attack front, infantry reserves were to be brought in to help take Klin (80 km north-west of Moscow), while 9th Army was to remain on the defensive. All maps, plans, and aerial reconnaissance photographs were only to be issued to corps headquarters for the moment.

It was further noted that the Soviets were strengthening to the immediate west along the front line of XXXXVII Corps (mot.) while simultaneously withdrawing forces from the western extremity of the Sukhinichi salient (between 4th Army in the north and 2nd Panzer Army in the south). Both instances could be seen as either preparation for an enemy attack or else defensive measures in expectation of a German advance. The situation was similar in the northern sector. On 4 June, local German intelligence noted that deserters had stated for the first time that the Soviet forces opposite the eastern front of 9th Army apparently had no offensive intentions but had instead assumed a defensive posture. Two days later, Army Group Center suggested that increased activity by scout parties and shock troops as well as reconnaissance operations in company to battalion strength demonstrated the “nervousness” of the Russians before 3rd Panzer and 9th Armies “in expectation of German attacks.”\n",

       "  'Throughout the recorded history of warfare, military planners and \\ncommanders have sought to deceive their adversary as to the size, tim-\\ning, or location of an attack, in order to gain a decisive advantage. From \\nthe famous “Trojan Horse” to modern efforts to use the electromagnetic \\nspectrum to “spoof” or “jam” sensors, deception in some form remains \\nan essential component of military operations. Whether attacking an un-\\nsuspecting enemy on Christmas morning, as Washington did at Trenton, \\nor emplacing “Quaker guns” (logs painted black to resemble cannon) to \\nprovide the impression of strength, US forces have successfully built on \\na long legacy of military deception (MILDEC) in order to prevail in the \\nnation’s wars. While technology continues to advance at a dizzying pace, \\nthreatening to render previous lessons obsolete, MILDEC operations have \\nsuccessfully withstood previous developments and even incorporated \\nnew technologies continue to form an important part of combat opera-\\ntions. While potentially capable, in some cases, of enabling military forces \\nto prevail without a fight, as the theorist Sun Tzu postulated, more often \\nMILDEC confers an advantage that helps the side that successfully har-\\nnesses it prevail, often at a much lower cost that it would have otherwise. \\nThus, MILDEC, and its long and successful history, remain an important, \\neven vital, tool for any future leader.\\n',\n",
