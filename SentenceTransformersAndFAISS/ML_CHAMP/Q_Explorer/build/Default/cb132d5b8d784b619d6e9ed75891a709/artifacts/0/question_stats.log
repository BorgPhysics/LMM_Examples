	Intermediate Summary Answer:
		 Oceans have warmed by nearly 20 to 30 percent since the beginning of the 19th century. Warm water on the surface helps to support the ocean's energy balance, with lower rates of greenhouse gas release. New research by scientists at the University of Cambridge provides new evidence as to why.

SUMMARIZED RESPONSE: Oceans have warmed by nearly 20 to 30 percent since the beginning of the 19th century. Warm water on the surface helps to support the ocean's energy balance, with lower rates of greenhouse gas release.
