This methodology submits the user question to the FAISS index to find all of the related sentences within the assigned parameter ranges.  It then uses the question and FAISS sentences as context for the final LMM.
ORIGINAL QUESTION: What are the main concerns with AI?

There are 5 unique docs in a total of 9

SUMMARIZED RESPONSE:  AI has the potential to be every bit as fraught with risk as prior cases, perhaps more so given the speed of technological progress. Privacy and data security remain critical concerns, as AI applications deal with vast amounts of personal information. The real benefits of AI over our current system will be from how it improves our ability to predict future behavior.
