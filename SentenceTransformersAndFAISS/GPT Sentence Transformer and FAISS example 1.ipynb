      "\n",
      "In the international legal context cultural diversity has been described as analogous to biodiversity7 The General Conference of UNESCO took this position in 2001 asserting in Article 1 of the Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity that cultural diversity is as necessary for humankind as biodiversity is for nature8 The authors John Cavanagh and Jerry Mander took this analogy further describing cultural diversity as a sort of cultural gene pool to spur innovation toward ever higher levels of social intellectual and spiritual accomplishment9\n",

      "Financial Markets Role in the Economy Importance Types and Examples\n",
      "By ADAM HAYES Updated October 19 2023\n",
      "Reviewed by CIERRA MURRY\n",
      "Fact checked by KIRSTEN ROHRS SCHMITT\n",
      "What Are Financial Markets\n",
      "Financial markets refer broadly to any marketplace where securities trading occurs including the stock market bond market forex market and derivatives market Financial markets are vital to the smooth operation of capitalist economies\n",
      "\n",
      "KEY TAKEAWAYS\n",
      "Financial markets refer broadly to any marketplace where the trading of securities occurs\n",
      "There are many kinds of financial markets including but not limited to forex money stock and bond markets\n",
      "These markets may include assets or securities that are either listed on regulated exchanges or trade overthecounter OTC\n",
      "Financial markets trade in all types of securities and are critical to the smooth operation of a capitalist society\n",
      "When financial markets fail economic disruption including recession and rising unemployment can result\n",
      "Financial Markets\n",
      "Investopedia  Theresa Chiechi\n",
      "\n",
      "Understanding the Financial Markets\n",
      "Financial markets play a vital role in facilitating the smooth operation of capitalist economies by allocating resources and creating liquidity for businesses and entrepreneurs The markets make it easy for buyers and sellers to trade their financial holdings Financial markets create securities products that provide a return for those with excess funds investorslenders and make these funds available to those needing additional money borrowers \n",
      "\n",
      "The stock market is just one type of financial market Financial markets are created when people buy and sell financial instruments including equities bonds currencies and derivatives Financial markets rely heavily on informational transparency to ensure that the markets set prices that are efficient and appropriate\n",
      "\n",
      "Some financial markets are small with little activity and others like the New York Stock Exchange NYSE trade trillions of dollars in securities daily The equities stock market is a financial market that enables investors to buy and sell shares of publicly traded companies The primary stock market is where new issues of stocks are sold Any subsequent trading of stocks occurs in the secondary market where investors buy and sell securities they already own\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " Prices of securities traded in the financial markets may not necessarily reflect their intrinsic value\n",
      "Types of Financial Markets\n",
      "There are several different types of markets Each one focuses on the types and classes of instruments available on it\n",
      "\n",
      "Stock Markets\n",
      "Perhaps the most ubiquitous of financial markets are stock markets These are venues where companies list their shares which are bought and sold by traders and investors Stock markets or equities markets are used by companies to raise capital and by investors to search for returns\n",
      "\n",
      "Stocks may be traded on listed exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange NYSE Nasdaq or the overthecounter OTC market Most stock trading is done via regulated exchanges which plays an important economic role because it is another way for money to flow through the economy\n",
      "\n",
      "Typical participants in a stock market include both retail and institutional investors traders market makers MMs and specialists who maintain liquidity and provide twosided markets Brokers are third parties that facilitate trades between buyers and sellers but who do not take an actual position in a stock\n",
      "\n",
      "OvertheCounter Markets\n",
      "An overthecounter OTC market is a decentralized marketmeaning it does not have physical locations and trading is conducted electronicallyin which market participants trade securities directly meaning without a broker While OTC markets may handle trading in certain stocks eg smaller or riskier companies that do not meet the listing criteria of exchanges most stock trading is done via exchanges Certain derivatives markets however are exclusively OTC making up an essential segment of the financial markets Broadly speaking OTC markets and the transactions that occur in them are far less regulated less liquid and more opaque\n",
      "\n",
      "Bond Markets\n",
      "A bond is a security in which an investor loans money for a defined period at a preestablished interest rate You may think of a bond as an agreement between the lender and borrower containing the loans details and its payments Bonds are issued by corporations as well as by municipalities states and sovereign governments to finance projects and operations For example the bond market sells securities such as notes and bills issued by the United States Treasury The bond market is also called the debt credit or fixedincome market\n",
      "\n",
      "Money Markets\n",
      "Typically the money markets trade in products with highly liquid shortterm maturities less than one year and are characterized by a high degree of safety and a relatively lower interest return than other markets\n",
      "\n",
      "At the wholesale level the money markets involve largevolume trades between institutions and traders At the retail level they include money market mutual funds bought by individual investors and money market accounts opened by bank customers Individuals may also invest in the money markets by purchasing shortterm certificates of deposit CDs municipal notes or US Treasury bills among other examples\n",
      "\n",
      "Derivatives Markets\n",
      "A derivative is a contract between two or more parties whose value is based on an agreedupon underlying financial asset like a security or set of assets like an index Rather than trading stocks directly a derivatives market trades in futures and options contracts and other advanced financial products that derive their value from underlying instruments like bonds commodities currencies interest rates market indexes and stocks\n",
      "\n",
      "Futures markets are where futures contracts are listed and traded Unlike forwards which trade OTC futures markets utilize standardized contract specifications are wellregulated and use clearinghouses to settle and confirm trades Options markets such as the Chicago Board Options Exchange Cboe similarly list and regulate options contracts Both futures and options exchanges may list contracts on various asset classes such as equities fixedincome securities commodities and so on\n",
      "\n",
      "Forex Market\n",
      "The forex foreign exchange market is where participants can buy sell hedge and speculate on the exchange rates between currency pairs The forex market is the most liquid market in the world as cash is the most liquid of assets The currency market handles more than 75 trillion in daily transactions more than the futures and equity markets combined\n",
      "1\n",
      "\n",
      "As with the OTC markets the forex market is also decentralized and consists of a global network of computers and brokers worldwide The forex market is made up of banks commercial companies central banks investment management firms hedge funds and retail forex brokers and investors\n",
      "\n",
      "Commodities Markets\n",
      "Commodities markets are venues where producers and consumers meet to exchange physical commodities such as agricultural products eg corn livestock soybeans energy products oil gas carbon credits precious metals gold silver platinum or soft commodities such as cotton coffee and sugar These are known as spot commodity markets where physical goods are exchanged for money\n",
      "\n",
      "However the bulk of trading in these commodities takes place on derivatives markets that utilize spot commodities as the underlying assets Forwards futures and options on commodities are exchanged both OTC and on listed exchanges around the world such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange CME and the Intercontinental Exchange ICE\n",
      "\n",
      "Cryptocurrency Markets\n",
      "Thousands of cryptocurrency tokens are available and traded globally across a patchwork of independent online crypto exchanges These exchanges host digital wallets for traders to swap one cryptocurrency for another or for fiat monies such as dollars or euros\n",
      "\n",
      "Because most crypto exchanges are centralized platforms users are susceptible to hacks or fraudulent activity Decentralized exchanges are also available that operate without any central authority These exchanges allow direct peertopeer P2P trading without an actual exchange authority to facilitate the transactions Futures and options trading are also available on major cryptocurrencies\n",
      "\n",
      "Examples of Financial Markets\n",
      "The above sections make clear that the financial markets are broad in scope and scale To give two more concrete examples we will consider the role of stock markets in bringing a company to IPO and the role of the OTC derivatives market in the 200809 financial crisis\n",
      "\n",
      "Stock Markets and IPOs\n",
      "As a company establishes itself over time and grows it needs access to additional capital It will often find itself in need of much larger amounts of capital than it can get from ongoing operations traditional bank loans or venture and angel funding Firms can raise the amount of capital they need by selling shares of itself to the public through an initial public offering IPO This changes the companys status from a private firm whose shares are held by a few shareholders to a publicly traded company whose shares will be subsequently held by public investors\n",
      "\n",
      "The IPO also offers early investors in the company an opportunity to cash out part of their stake often reaping very handsome rewards in the process Initially the underwriters usually set the IPO price through their premarketing process\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the companys shares are listed on a stock exchange and trading commences the price of these shares will fluctuate as investors and traders assess and reassess their intrinsic value and the supply and demand for those shares at any given moment\n",
      "\n",
      "OTC Derivatives and the 2008 Financial Crisis MBS and CDOs\n",
      "While the 200809 financial crisis was caused and made worse by several factors one factor that has been widely identified is the market for mortgagebacked securities MBS\n",
      "2\n",
      " These are OTC derivatives where cash flows from individual mortgages are bundled sliced up and sold to investors The crisis resulted from a sequence of events each with its own triggerthese events culminated in the banking systems nearcollapse It has been argued that the seeds of the crisis were sown as far back as the 1970s with the Community Development Act which required banks to loosen their credit requirements for lowerincome consumers creating a market for subprime mortgages\n",
      "\n",
      "The amount of subprime mortgage debt guaranteed by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae continued to expand into the early 2000s when the Federal Reserve Board began to cut interest rates drastically to avoid a recession\n",
      "3\n",
      " The combination of loose credit requirements and cheap money spurred a housing boom which drove speculation pushing up housing prices and creating a real estate bubble In the meantime the investment banks looking for easy profits in the wake of the dotcom bust and the 2001 recession created a type of MBS called collateralized debt obligations CDOs from the mortgages purchased on the secondary market\n",
      "\n",
      "Because subprime mortgages were bundled with prime mortgages there was no way for investors to understand the risks associated with the product When the market for CDOs began to heat up the housing bubble that had been building for several years finally burst As housing prices fell subprime borrowers began to default on loans that were worth more than their homes accelerating the decline in prices\n",
      "\n",
      "When investors realized the MBS and CDOs were worthless due to the toxic debt they represented they attempted to unload the obligations However there was no market for the CDOs The subsequent cascade of subprime lender failures created liquidity contagion that reached the upper tiers of the banking system Two major investment banks Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns collapsed under the weight of their exposure to subprime debt and more than 450 banks failed over the next five years\n",
      "4\n",
      " Several major banks were on the brink of failure and were rescued by a taxpayerfunded bailout\n",
      "\n",
      "What Are the Different Types of Financial Markets\n",
      "Some examples of financial markets and their roles include the stock market the bond market forex commodities and the real estate market among others Financial markets can also be broken down into capital markets money markets primary vs secondary markets and listed vs OTC markets\n",
      "\n",
      "How Do Financial Markets Work\n",
      "Despite covering many different asset classes and having various structures and regulations all financial markets work essentially by bringing together buyers and sellers in some asset or contract and allowing them to trade with one another This is often done through an auction or pricediscovery mechanism\n",
      "\n",
      "What Are the Main Functions of Financial Markets\n",
      "Financial markets exist for several reasons but the most fundamental function is to allow for the efficient allocation of capital and assets in a financial economy By allowing a free market for the flow of capital financial obligations and money the financial markets make the global economy run more smoothly while allowing investors to participate in capital gains over time\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bottom Line\n",
      "Financial markets provide liquidity capital and participation that are essential for economic growth and stability Without financial markets capital could not be allocated efficiently and economic activity such as commerce and trade investments and growth opportunities would be greatly diminished\n",
      "\n",
      "Many players make markets an essential part of the economyfirms use stock and bond markets to raise capital from investors Speculators look to various asset classes to make directional bets on future prices At the same time hedgers use derivatives markets to mitigate various risks and arbitrageurs seek to take advantage of mispricings or anomalies observed across various markets Brokers often act as mediators that bring buyers and sellers together earning a commission or fee for their services\n",

      "Americans Name the 10 Most Significant Historic Events of Their Lifetimes\n",
      "911 Obama election and the tech revolution among those with greatest impact on the country\n",
      "\n",
      "Shared experiences define what it means to be an American The Sept 11 2001 terrorist attacks were such a unifying event for modern Americans Nothing else has come close to being as important or as memorable according to a new survey conducted by Pew Research Center in association with AE Networks HISTORY\n",
      "\n",
      "Roughly threequarters 76 of the public include the Sept 11 terror attacks as one of the 10 events during their lifetime with the greatest impact on the country according to a national online survey of 2025 adults conducted June 16July 4 2016\n",
      "\n",
      "The perceived historic importance of the attacks on New York and the Pentagon span virtually every traditional demographic divide Majorities of men and women Millennials and Baby Boomers Americans with college degrees and those without a high school diploma rate 911 as one of the 10 most historically significant events to occur during their lifetime And while they seem to agree on little else this election year the survey finds that more than seveninten Republicans and Democrats name the attacks as one of their top 10 historic events\n",
      "\n",
      "The one exception to this pattern is the views of blacks and whites While the Sept 11 attacks easily top the list for whites it shares the top spot with the election of President Barack Obama among blacks Similarly the civil rights movement ranks behind only the election of Obama and 911 on the list of most significant events for blacks but is absent from the top 10 lifetime events for whites\n",
      "\n",
      "Just as striking as the publics consensus on the impact of 911 is the steep dropoff in the proportion of Americans who name other notable events The election of Obama is the secondmost frequently named event listed by 40 of the public Every other event is named by fewer than onequarter of all adults This includes the changes ushered in by the internet personal computers smartphones and other innovations of the tech revolution the assassination of John F Kennedy and the Vietnam War\n",
      "\n",
      "To measure how Americans view the importance of recent historic events Pew Research Center conducted a national probabilitybased survey with a representative sample of adults who are members of the GfK KnowledgePanel a national probabilitybased online panel Pew Research Center received supplemental funding from HISTORY to conduct this survey\n",
      "\n",
      "Survey participants were asked to list the 10 historic events that occurred during their lifetimes that they thought have had the greatest impact on the country Respondents were further told that they could name a specific event a series of related events or any other historic development that had a major influence on American life\n",
      "\n",
      "The survey finds that Americans are primarily bound together by their generation and the major events that occurred during their formative years For the oldest Americans the Silent and Greatest generations that unifying event is World War II For Baby Boomers the assassination of John F Kennedy and the Vietnam War are defining moments For Millennials and Gen Xers the 911 terror attacks and the Obama election leads the list by a greater margin than for other generations\n",
      "\n",
      "The top 10 list for these young Americans also varies from the rankings of other generations For example the Columbine school shooting makes the top 10 list of Millennials and Gen Xers but not Boomers or the Silent Generation Millennials also are unique in that five of their top 10 events  the Sandy Hook and OrlandoPulse nightclub shootings the death of Osama bin Laden the Boston Marathon bombing and the Great Recession  appear in no other generations top 10 list\n",
      "\n",
      "The publics responses to two other survey questions are even more varied When asked to name the historic event that made them feel the proudest of their country the countrys collective response to Sept 11 led the list although it is only named by 19 of adults The Obama election finishes a distant second with 14 while the moon landing the killing of bin Laden and the legalization of gay marriage receive singledigit support\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time the Obama presidency and the presidential campaign of Republican Donald Trump top the rankings of events that most disappoint the country about one in ten named each views that are clearly associated with the partisan leanings of respondents\n",
      "\n",
      "The remainder of this report explores these results in more detail The first sections report the similarities and differences in the rankings by generation race and ethnicity gender income education political party and region of the country The following sections examine events Americans consider the most significant to the country and to them personally and which occurrence makes them the proudest and most disappointed in their country\n",
      "\n",
      "Generations experience recent history through the lens of their lifetimes\n",
      "\n",
      "How to interpret the generational data\n",
      "Since the survey question asks respondents to name events that occurred during their lifetimes a number of these results are highly agespecific and should be interpreted in that light Younger adults  Millennials and Gen Xers  have experienced fewer historic events simply because they have not lived as long as Baby Boomers or members of the Silent Generation In other words the fact that younger Americans dont list World War II doesnt mean they believe the Second World War is not a historically important event it just means it was not an event that occurred in their lifetime\n",
      "\n",
      "Like people generations have distinctive identities that are linked in part to singular events that occurred during their members formative years For the oldest Americans the Silent and Greatest generations1 that unifying event is World War II These men and women name the Second World War 44 near the top of their list of important events behind only 911 59\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly the assassination of John F Kennedy the Vietnam War and the Apollo 11 moon landing stand out on Baby Boomers list of major historic events that occurred in their lifetimes Fully 45 of Boomers list the Kennedy assassination as one of their top 10 events while nearly as many 41 name the Vietnam War and about a third 35 name the moon landing events that also appear on the Silent Generations top 10 list\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "While much of the historic record remains largely to be written for the Millennials and Generation X two singular historic events already stand out at the top of their lists Sept 11 and the election of Barack Obama the first black president These younger generations are unique in the high level of consensus of their rankings Fully 86 of Millennials list 911 as a significant event in their lifetimes and 47 name the Obama presidency Likewise 79 of Gen Xers name Sept 11 at the top of their list while 40 list Obamas election Among older generations a larger selection of historic events garners mention by more than a quarter of their members\n",
      "\n",
      "The generations differ primarily in the relative importance they place on Sept 11 compared with the Obama presidency The Sept 11 terrorist attacks are the single most frequently mentioned historic event across all generations However the proportions of each generation who share this view differ significantly\n",
      "\n",
      "For example almost nineinten Millennials 86 name the terror attacks as an important historic event compared with 59 of those in the Silent Generation or older\n",
      "\n",
      "Obamas election and presidency finishes as the secondmost frequently named historic event among Millennials and Gen Xers 47 and 40 respectively By contrast among members of the Silent Generation Obamas election 28 finishes well behind three other historic events 911 59 World War II 44 and the assassination of John F Kennedy 41\n",
      "\n",
      "Millennials have entered into the stream of history relatively recently and as a result a number of modern events stand out more to them than to their counterparts in other generations The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan make the top 10 list of Millennials 24 and Gen Xers 18 but barely make the top rankings of Baby Boomers 11 The US Supreme Court decision legalizing gay marriage makes the top 10 list of Millennials 19 but is mentioned significantly less often by Gen Xers 10 Baby Boomers 7 and members of the Silent Generation 3 And the Orlando shooting ranks as one of the top historic events that have occurred in the lives of Millennials 17 compared with 9 of Gen Xers 7 of Boomers and 6 of Silents\n",
      "\n",
      "Millennials are also unique in that five of their top 10 events appear in no other generations top 10 the Killing of Osama bin Laden 10 the Sandy Hook school shootings 7 the Boston Marathon bombing 7 and the Great Recession 7 In addition the Gulf War and the Challenger disaster are only named by Gen X 15 and 14 respectively while the Martin Luther King Jr assassination 15 appears on only one generations list  Baby Boomers\n",
      "\n",
      "To some extent these findings are predictable Young Americans simply have not lived long enough to have experienced the same number of historymaking events of older adults Conversely some events like World War II could only be experienced by one generation and other events like the Korean War occurred during another generations formative years\n",
      "\n",
      "Just four events appear on the top 10 lists of all four generations Sept 11 the Obama election the wars in IraqAfghanistan and the tech revolution\n",
      "\n",
      "For blacks Obama presidency ranks with 911 as most significant event\n",
      "Blacks and whites view recent history differently in several key ways beginning at the very top of the rankings Blacks are the only demographic group in which any other historic event challenges the prominence of Sept 11 in importance Specifically among blacks as many people roughly sixinten named Barack Obamas election as one of the top 10 historic events of their lifetime as named Sept 11 Among whites Obamas election ranks a distant second 36 compared with the 80 who name Sept 11\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Not surprisingly events related to the black struggle for equal rights also have particular relevance to black Americans though far less so for whites Among blacks 18 say the civil rights movement 2 is one of the 10 most significant events to occur during their lifetimes By contrast only 8 of whites cite the civil rights movement  and it fails to make their top 10 events list\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though the fight for black equality continues today the civil rights movement is more salient to blacks who lived during the 1960s when many of the seminal events of the movement occurred Among blacks ages 45 and older roughly a third 32 rate the struggle for equal rights as a touchstone event in their lives\n",
      "\n",
      "Eight of the 10 events on the top 10 lists of blacks and whites are the same Beyond 911 and the Obama election the top 10 lists of blacks and whites include the assassination of John F Kennedy the tech revolution Vietnam IraqAfghanistan wars the Gulf War and the moon landing\n",
      "\n",
      "On six of the eight events that appeared on both lists significantly smaller proportions of blacks view the event as impactful compared with whites For example the tech revolution appears on both top 10 lists and is cited by 28 of whites but only 12 of blacks Similarly the Vietnam War is cited by 26 of whites but 11 of blacks\n",
      "\n",
      "Much like the civil rights movement the historical significance of the Martin Luther King Jr assassination is perceived differently by blacks and whites Some 14 of black respondents name the civil rights leaders assassination compared with only 7 of whites Further while the MLK assassination ranks fifth for blacks it fails to make the top 10 list of historic events for whites\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile the OrlandoPulse nightclub shooting ranks relatively high among Hispanics mentioned by 19 By contrast 9 of whites and 7 of blacks say this mass shooting is equally momentous While these data cannot explain why Latinos disproportionately see the OrlandoPulse mass shooting as historically significant the circumstances of the attack provide some clues The attack occurred on the night that Pulse a popular nightclub was hosting a Latin Night celebration and counts immediately after the tragedy indicate that 90 of the 49 murder victims were Latino Also the shooting victims were predominantly young and Hispanics as a group are disproportionately young relative to the white and black populations\n",
      "\n",
      "Republicans Democrats have more similarities than differences\n",
      "The events in American history named by Republicans and Democrats overlap substantially and differences between the two parties are primarily a matter of degree Large majorities of both Republicans 80 and Democrats 74 name Sept 11 as a significant event in their lifetimes While both parties name the election of Obama as president the secondmost often Democrats are somewhat more likely than Republicans to cite this event 46 vs 33\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "No real gender gap in views of historic events\n",
      "When it comes to evaluating recent American history the new survey data suggest there is little to no gender gap in the way men and women rank the events that shape their times As is true across generations Sept 11 stands out by far as the most impactful event among both men and women with Obamas election following as a distant second Other events are clustered in roughly similar patterns among both sexes and include the tech revolution the Vietnam War and the moon landing These events are named by between 15 and 25 of both male and female respondents\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of differences the recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan rank higher among men fifth at 21 than among women eighth at 14 The Gulf War that took place during the George HW Bush administration is named by 12 of men and 8 of women Women are slightly more likely to name gay marriage 14 do compared with 8 of men\n",
      "\n",
      "Across regions 911 tops the list\n",
      "\n",
      "Americans living in various parts of the US think remarkably alike about the historic events that have had the greatest impact on the country Sept 11 tops each regional list by a large margin from the attacks geographical centers of New York City and outside Washington DC to the West Coast Fully 80 in the Northeast name the terrorist attacks as do 77 of those in the Midwest 75 in the West and 74 in the South\n",
      "\n",
      "As has been true across various demographic breaks the election of Barack Obama as commander in chief ranks a clear but distant second\n",
      "\n",
      "The differences from there are limited and subtle in fact the percentages for a given event rarely differ between regions by more than 5 points\n",
      "\n",
      "Tech plays somewhat differently across education income\n",
      "\n",
      "Across education and income levels Americans are consistent in the events they name as historic with a few notable variations As is true across many other demographic breaks Sept 11 tops the list of responses in each education level by a wide margin followed by the election of President Barack Obama\n",
      "\n",

      "Governments and international bodies use cultural diversity in both a broad and a narrow sense The broad meaning takes its inspiration from anthropology3 It includes lifestyles value systems traditions and beliefs in addition to creative works It emphasises an ongoing process of interaction and dialogue between cultures45 This meaning has been promoted to the international community by UNESCO since the 2001 Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity In practice governments use a narrower more traditional meaning that focuses on the economic domain mentioned above6\n",
      "\n",
      "In the international legal context cultural diversity has been described as analogous to biodiversity7 The General Conference of UNESCO took this position in 2001 asserting in Article 1 of the Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity that cultural diversity is as necessary for humankind as biodiversity is for nature8 The authors John Cavanagh and Jerry Mander took this analogy further describing cultural diversity as a sort of cultural gene pool to spur innovation toward ever higher levels of social intellectual and spiritual accomplishment9\n",

      "\n",
      "Another aspect of cultural diversity is measured by counting the number of languages spoken in a region or in the world as a whole By this measure the worlds cultural diversity is rapidly declining Research carried out in the 1990s by David Crystal suggested that at that time on average one language was falling into disuse every two weeks He calculated that if that rate of the language death were to continue then by the year 2100 more than 90 of the languages currently spoken in the world will have gone extinct12\n",

      "Cultural policy scholar Johnathan Vickery has observed that cultural diversity like biological diversity is continually under threat from various factors These threats often come from other cultural expressions as when imported entertainment undermines interest in a nations own culture Other examples he mentions include religious revivals and modern Western education systems30 Factors that promote a countrys cultural diversity include migration and a nations openness to discussing and celebrating cultural differences which is itself an aspect of culture31\n",

      "Financial markets refer broadly to any marketplace where the trading of securities occurs\n",
      "There are many kinds of financial markets including but not limited to forex money stock and bond markets\n",
      "These markets may include assets or securities that are either listed on regulated exchanges or trade overthecounter OTC\n",
      "Financial markets trade in all types of securities and are critical to the smooth operation of a capitalist society\n",
      "When financial markets fail economic disruption including recession and rising unemployment can result\n",

      "Investopedia  Theresa Chiechi\n",
      "\n",
      "Understanding the Financial Markets\n",
      "Financial markets play a vital role in facilitating the smooth operation of capitalist economies by allocating resources and creating liquidity for businesses and entrepreneurs The markets make it easy for buyers and sellers to trade their financial holdings Financial markets create securities products that provide a return for those with excess funds investorslenders and make these funds available to those needing additional money borrowers \n",
      "\n",
      "The stock market is just one type of financial market Financial markets are created when people buy and sell financial instruments including equities bonds currencies and derivatives Financial markets rely heavily on informational transparency to ensure that the markets set prices that are efficient and appropriate\n",
      "\n",
      "Some financial markets are small with little activity and others like the New York Stock Exchange NYSE trade trillions of dollars in securities daily The equities stock market is a financial market that enables investors to buy and sell shares of publicly traded companies The primary stock market is where new issues of stocks are sold Any subsequent trading of stocks occurs in the secondary market where investors buy and sell securities they already own\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " Prices of securities traded in the financial markets may not necessarily reflect their intrinsic value\n",
      "Types of Financial Markets\n",
      "There are several different types of markets Each one focuses on the types and classes of instruments available on it\n",
      "\n",
      "Stock Markets\n",
      "Perhaps the most ubiquitous of financial markets are stock markets These are venues where companies list their shares which are bought and sold by traders and investors Stock markets or equities markets are used by companies to raise capital and by investors to search for returns\n",
      "\n",
      "Stocks may be traded on listed exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange NYSE Nasdaq or the overthecounter OTC market Most stock trading is done via regulated exchanges which plays an important economic role because it is another way for money to flow through the economy\n",
      "\n",
      "Typical participants in a stock market include both retail and institutional investors traders market makers MMs and specialists who maintain liquidity and provide twosided markets Brokers are third parties that facilitate trades between buyers and sellers but who do not take an actual position in a stock\n",
      "\n",
      "OvertheCounter Markets\n",
      "An overthecounter OTC market is a decentralized marketmeaning it does not have physical locations and trading is conducted electronicallyin which market participants trade securities directly meaning without a broker While OTC markets may handle trading in certain stocks eg smaller or riskier companies that do not meet the listing criteria of exchanges most stock trading is done via exchanges Certain derivatives markets however are exclusively OTC making up an essential segment of the financial markets Broadly speaking OTC markets and the transactions that occur in them are far less regulated less liquid and more opaque\n",
      "\n",
      "Bond Markets\n",
      "A bond is a security in which an investor loans money for a defined period at a preestablished interest rate You may think of a bond as an agreement between the lender and borrower containing the loans details and its payments Bonds are issued by corporations as well as by municipalities states and sovereign governments to finance projects and operations For example the bond market sells securities such as notes and bills issued by the United States Treasury The bond market is also called the debt credit or fixedincome market\n",
      "\n",
      "Money Markets\n",
      "Typically the money markets trade in products with highly liquid shortterm maturities less than one year and are characterized by a high degree of safety and a relatively lower interest return than other markets\n",
      "\n",
      "At the wholesale level the money markets involve largevolume trades between institutions and traders At the retail level they include money market mutual funds bought by individual investors and money market accounts opened by bank customers Individuals may also invest in the money markets by purchasing shortterm certificates of deposit CDs municipal notes or US Treasury bills among other examples\n",
      "\n",
      "Derivatives Markets\n",
      "A derivative is a contract between two or more parties whose value is based on an agreedupon underlying financial asset like a security or set of assets like an index Rather than trading stocks directly a derivatives market trades in futures and options contracts and other advanced financial products that derive their value from underlying instruments like bonds commodities currencies interest rates market indexes and stocks\n",
      "\n",
      "Futures markets are where futures contracts are listed and traded Unlike forwards which trade OTC futures markets utilize standardized contract specifications are wellregulated and use clearinghouses to settle and confirm trades Options markets such as the Chicago Board Options Exchange Cboe similarly list and regulate options contracts Both futures and options exchanges may list contracts on various asset classes such as equities fixedincome securities commodities and so on\n",
      "\n",
      "Forex Market\n",
      "The forex foreign exchange market is where participants can buy sell hedge and speculate on the exchange rates between currency pairs The forex market is the most liquid market in the world as cash is the most liquid of assets The currency market handles more than 75 trillion in daily transactions more than the futures and equity markets combined\n",
      "1\n",
      "\n",
      "As with the OTC markets the forex market is also decentralized and consists of a global network of computers and brokers worldwide The forex market is made up of banks commercial companies central banks investment management firms hedge funds and retail forex brokers and investors\n",
      "\n",
      "Commodities Markets\n",
      "Commodities markets are venues where producers and consumers meet to exchange physical commodities such as agricultural products eg corn livestock soybeans energy products oil gas carbon credits precious metals gold silver platinum or soft commodities such as cotton coffee and sugar These are known as spot commodity markets where physical goods are exchanged for money\n",
      "\n",
      "However the bulk of trading in these commodities takes place on derivatives markets that utilize spot commodities as the underlying assets Forwards futures and options on commodities are exchanged both OTC and on listed exchanges around the world such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange CME and the Intercontinental Exchange ICE\n",
      "\n",
      "Cryptocurrency Markets\n",
      "Thousands of cryptocurrency tokens are available and traded globally across a patchwork of independent online crypto exchanges These exchanges host digital wallets for traders to swap one cryptocurrency for another or for fiat monies such as dollars or euros\n",
      "\n",
      "Because most crypto exchanges are centralized platforms users are susceptible to hacks or fraudulent activity Decentralized exchanges are also available that operate without any central authority These exchanges allow direct peertopeer P2P trading without an actual exchange authority to facilitate the transactions Futures and options trading are also available on major cryptocurrencies\n",
      "\n",
      "Examples of Financial Markets\n",
      "The above sections make clear that the financial markets are broad in scope and scale To give two more concrete examples we will consider the role of stock markets in bringing a company to IPO and the role of the OTC derivatives market in the 200809 financial crisis\n",
      "\n",
      "Stock Markets and IPOs\n",
      "As a company establishes itself over time and grows it needs access to additional capital It will often find itself in need of much larger amounts of capital than it can get from ongoing operations traditional bank loans or venture and angel funding Firms can raise the amount of capital they need by selling shares of itself to the public through an initial public offering IPO This changes the companys status from a private firm whose shares are held by a few shareholders to a publicly traded company whose shares will be subsequently held by public investors\n",
      "\n",
      "The IPO also offers early investors in the company an opportunity to cash out part of their stake often reaping very handsome rewards in the process Initially the underwriters usually set the IPO price through their premarketing process\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the companys shares are listed on a stock exchange and trading commences the price of these shares will fluctuate as investors and traders assess and reassess their intrinsic value and the supply and demand for those shares at any given moment\n",
      "\n",
      "OTC Derivatives and the 2008 Financial Crisis MBS and CDOs\n",
      "While the 200809 financial crisis was caused and made worse by several factors one factor that has been widely identified is the market for mortgagebacked securities MBS\n",
      "2\n",
      " These are OTC derivatives where cash flows from individual mortgages are bundled sliced up and sold to investors The crisis resulted from a sequence of events each with its own triggerthese events culminated in the banking systems nearcollapse It has been argued that the seeds of the crisis were sown as far back as the 1970s with the Community Development Act which required banks to loosen their credit requirements for lowerincome consumers creating a market for subprime mortgages\n",
      "\n",
      "The amount of subprime mortgage debt guaranteed by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae continued to expand into the early 2000s when the Federal Reserve Board began to cut interest rates drastically to avoid a recession\n",
      "3\n",
      " The combination of loose credit requirements and cheap money spurred a housing boom which drove speculation pushing up housing prices and creating a real estate bubble In the meantime the investment banks looking for easy profits in the wake of the dotcom bust and the 2001 recession created a type of MBS called collateralized debt obligations CDOs from the mortgages purchased on the secondary market\n",
      "\n",
      "Because subprime mortgages were bundled with prime mortgages there was no way for investors to understand the risks associated with the product When the market for CDOs began to heat up the housing bubble that had been building for several years finally burst As housing prices fell subprime borrowers began to default on loans that were worth more than their homes accelerating the decline in prices\n",
      "\n",
      "When investors realized the MBS and CDOs were worthless due to the toxic debt they represented they attempted to unload the obligations However there was no market for the CDOs The subsequent cascade of subprime lender failures created liquidity contagion that reached the upper tiers of the banking system Two major investment banks Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns collapsed under the weight of their exposure to subprime debt and more than 450 banks failed over the next five years\n",
      "4\n",
      " Several major banks were on the brink of failure and were rescued by a taxpayerfunded bailout\n",
      "\n",
      "What Are the Different Types of Financial Markets\n",
      "Some examples of financial markets and their roles include the stock market the bond market forex commodities and the real estate market among others Financial markets can also be broken down into capital markets money markets primary vs secondary markets and listed vs OTC markets\n",
      "\n",
      "How Do Financial Markets Work\n",
      "Despite covering many different asset classes and having various structures and regulations all financial markets work essentially by bringing together buyers and sellers in some asset or contract and allowing them to trade with one another This is often done through an auction or pricediscovery mechanism\n",
      "\n",
      "What Are the Main Functions of Financial Markets\n",
      "Financial markets exist for several reasons but the most fundamental function is to allow for the efficient allocation of capital and assets in a financial economy By allowing a free market for the flow of capital financial obligations and money the financial markets make the global economy run more smoothly while allowing investors to participate in capital gains over time\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bottom Line\n",
      "Financial markets provide liquidity capital and participation that are essential for economic growth and stability Without financial markets capital could not be allocated efficiently and economic activity such as commerce and trade investments and growth opportunities would be greatly diminished\n",
      "\n",
      "Many players make markets an essential part of the economyfirms use stock and bond markets to raise capital from investors Speculators look to various asset classes to make directional bets on future prices At the same time hedgers use derivatives markets to mitigate various risks and arbitrageurs seek to take advantage of mispricings or anomalies observed across various markets Brokers often act as mediators that bring buyers and sellers together earning a commission or fee for their services\n",

      "\n",
      "Just as striking as the publics consensus on the impact of 911 is the steep dropoff in the proportion of Americans who name other notable events The election of Obama is the secondmost frequently named event listed by 40 of the public Every other event is named by fewer than onequarter of all adults This includes the changes ushered in by the internet personal computers smartphones and other innovations of the tech revolution the assassination of John F Kennedy and the Vietnam War\n",

      "The survey finds that Americans are primarily bound together by their generation and the major events that occurred during their formative years For the oldest Americans the Silent and Greatest generations that unifying event is World War II For Baby Boomers the assassination of John F Kennedy and the Vietnam War are defining moments For Millennials and Gen Xers the 911 terror attacks and the Obama election leads the list by a greater margin than for other generations\n",

      "The top 10 list for these young Americans also varies from the rankings of other generations For example the Columbine school shooting makes the top 10 list of Millennials and Gen Xers but not Boomers or the Silent Generation Millennials also are unique in that five of their top 10 events  the Sandy Hook and OrlandoPulse nightclub shootings the death of Osama bin Laden the Boston Marathon bombing and the Great Recession  appear in no other generations top 10 list\n",
      "\n",
      "The publics responses to two other survey questions are even more varied When asked to name the historic event that made them feel the proudest of their country the countrys collective response to Sept 11 led the list although it is only named by 19 of adults The Obama election finishes a distant second with 14 while the moon landing the killing of bin Laden and the legalization of gay marriage receive singledigit support\n",

      "How to interpret the generational data\n",
      "Since the survey question asks respondents to name events that occurred during their lifetimes a number of these results are highly agespecific and should be interpreted in that light Younger adults  Millennials and Gen Xers  have experienced fewer historic events simply because they have not lived as long as Baby Boomers or members of the Silent Generation In other words the fact that younger Americans dont list World War II doesnt mean they believe the Second World War is not a historically important event it just means it was not an event that occurred in their lifetime\n",
      "\n",
      "Like people generations have distinctive identities that are linked in part to singular events that occurred during their members formative years For the oldest Americans the Silent and Greatest generations1 that unifying event is World War II These men and women name the Second World War 44 near the top of their list of important events behind only 911 59\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly the assassination of John F Kennedy the Vietnam War and the Apollo 11 moon landing stand out on Baby Boomers list of major historic events that occurred in their lifetimes Fully 45 of Boomers list the Kennedy assassination as one of their top 10 events while nearly as many 41 name the Vietnam War and about a third 35 name the moon landing events that also appear on the Silent Generations top 10 list\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "While much of the historic record remains largely to be written for the Millennials and Generation X two singular historic events already stand out at the top of their lists Sept 11 and the election of Barack Obama the first black president These younger generations are unique in the high level of consensus of their rankings Fully 86 of Millennials list 911 as a significant event in their lifetimes and 47 name the Obama presidency Likewise 79 of Gen Xers name Sept 11 at the top of their list while 40 list Obamas election Among older generations a larger selection of historic events garners mention by more than a quarter of their members\n",
      "\n",
      "The generations differ primarily in the relative importance they place on Sept 11 compared with the Obama presidency The Sept 11 terrorist attacks are the single most frequently mentioned historic event across all generations However the proportions of each generation who share this view differ significantly\n",
      "\n",
      "For example almost nineinten Millennials 86 name the terror attacks as an important historic event compared with 59 of those in the Silent Generation or older\n",
      "\n",
      "Obamas election and presidency finishes as the secondmost frequently named historic event among Millennials and Gen Xers 47 and 40 respectively By contrast among members of the Silent Generation Obamas election 28 finishes well behind three other historic events 911 59 World War II 44 and the assassination of John F Kennedy 41\n",
      "\n",
      "Millennials have entered into the stream of history relatively recently and as a result a number of modern events stand out more to them than to their counterparts in other generations The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan make the top 10 list of Millennials 24 and Gen Xers 18 but barely make the top rankings of Baby Boomers 11 The US Supreme Court decision legalizing gay marriage makes the top 10 list of Millennials 19 but is mentioned significantly less often by Gen Xers 10 Baby Boomers 7 and members of the Silent Generation 3 And the Orlando shooting ranks as one of the top historic events that have occurred in the lives of Millennials 17 compared with 9 of Gen Xers 7 of Boomers and 6 of Silents\n",
      "\n",
      "Millennials are also unique in that five of their top 10 events appear in no other generations top 10 the Killing of Osama bin Laden 10 the Sandy Hook school shootings 7 the Boston Marathon bombing 7 and the Great Recession 7 In addition the Gulf War and the Challenger disaster are only named by Gen X 15 and 14 respectively while the Martin Luther King Jr assassination 15 appears on only one generations list  Baby Boomers\n",
      "\n",
      "To some extent these findings are predictable Young Americans simply have not lived long enough to have experienced the same number of historymaking events of older adults Conversely some events like World War II could only be experienced by one generation and other events like the Korean War occurred during another generations formative years\n",

      "For blacks Obama presidency ranks with 911 as most significant event\n",
      "Blacks and whites view recent history differently in several key ways beginning at the very top of the rankings Blacks are the only demographic group in which any other historic event challenges the prominence of Sept 11 in importance Specifically among blacks as many people roughly sixinten named Barack Obamas election as one of the top 10 historic events of their lifetime as named Sept 11 Among whites Obamas election ranks a distant second 36 compared with the 80 who name Sept 11\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Not surprisingly events related to the black struggle for equal rights also have particular relevance to black Americans though far less so for whites Among blacks 18 say the civil rights movement 2 is one of the 10 most significant events to occur during their lifetimes By contrast only 8 of whites cite the civil rights movement  and it fails to make their top 10 events list\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though the fight for black equality continues today the civil rights movement is more salient to blacks who lived during the 1960s when many of the seminal events of the movement occurred Among blacks ages 45 and older roughly a third 32 rate the struggle for equal rights as a touchstone event in their lives\n",
      "\n",
      "Eight of the 10 events on the top 10 lists of blacks and whites are the same Beyond 911 and the Obama election the top 10 lists of blacks and whites include the assassination of John F Kennedy the tech revolution Vietnam IraqAfghanistan wars the Gulf War and the moon landing\n",
      "\n",
      "On six of the eight events that appeared on both lists significantly smaller proportions of blacks view the event as impactful compared with whites For example the tech revolution appears on both top 10 lists and is cited by 28 of whites but only 12 of blacks Similarly the Vietnam War is cited by 26 of whites but 11 of blacks\n",
      "\n",
      "Much like the civil rights movement the historical significance of the Martin Luther King Jr assassination is perceived differently by blacks and whites Some 14 of black respondents name the civil rights leaders assassination compared with only 7 of whites Further while the MLK assassination ranks fifth for blacks it fails to make the top 10 list of historic events for whites\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile the OrlandoPulse nightclub shooting ranks relatively high among Hispanics mentioned by 19 By contrast 9 of whites and 7 of blacks say this mass shooting is equally momentous While these data cannot explain why Latinos disproportionately see the OrlandoPulse mass shooting as historically significant the circumstances of the attack provide some clues The attack occurred on the night that Pulse a popular nightclub was hosting a Latin Night celebration and counts immediately after the tragedy indicate that 90 of the 49 murder victims were Latino Also the shooting victims were predominantly young and Hispanics as a group are disproportionately young relative to the white and black populations\n",
      "\n",
      "Republicans Democrats have more similarities than differences\n",
      "The events in American history named by Republicans and Democrats overlap substantially and differences between the two parties are primarily a matter of degree Large majorities of both Republicans 80 and Democrats 74 name Sept 11 as a significant event in their lifetimes While both parties name the election of Obama as president the secondmost often Democrats are somewhat more likely than Republicans to cite this event 46 vs 33\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "No real gender gap in views of historic events\n",
      "When it comes to evaluating recent American history the new survey data suggest there is little to no gender gap in the way men and women rank the events that shape their times As is true across generations Sept 11 stands out by far as the most impactful event among both men and women with Obamas election following as a distant second Other events are clustered in roughly similar patterns among both sexes and include the tech revolution the Vietnam War and the moon landing These events are named by between 15 and 25 of both male and female respondents\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of differences the recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan rank higher among men fifth at 21 than among women eighth at 14 The Gulf War that took place during the George HW Bush administration is named by 12 of men and 8 of women Women are slightly more likely to name gay marriage 14 do compared with 8 of men\n",

      "\n",
      "As has been true across various demographic breaks the election of Barack Obama as commander in chief ranks a clear but distant second\n",

      "Tech plays somewhat differently across education income\n",
      "\n",
      "Across education and income levels Americans are consistent in the events they name as historic with a few notable variations As is true across many other demographic breaks Sept 11 tops the list of responses in each education level by a wide margin followed by the election of President Barack Obama\n",
      "\n",
      "While the tech revolution makes the top 10 list of respondents in each education level those with at least some college experience are more likely to cite these advancements than those with a high school diploma or less A third of those with a college degree and 23 of those with some college experience name the tech revolution compared with 14 of those with a high school diploma or less The same pattern occurs across income groups\n",
      "\n",
      "Little consensus on proudest or most disappointing moments\n",
      "\n",
      "Americans were also invited to weigh in on the times and events that made them most proud of their country and those that left them feeling most disappointed Perhaps the most significant finding is that there is much less agreement on this front than when it comes to naming events that are historically important in that no one answer is named by more than a quarter of the public\n",
      "\n",
      "To the extent that Americans coalesce upon a point of pride it is the nations response to 911 including mentions of the bravery of first responders the outpouring of genuine sympathy for victims or the way the country united after the terrorist attacks Overall 19 cite this as the moment they felt most proud of America\n",
      "\n",
      "The election of Barack Obama ranks second named by 14 as one of the countrys finest moments Yet nearly as large a share of the public 11 see his election or presidency as their biggest disappointment Right there with Obama at the top of the disappointments list is the Republican primary election campaign that led to the nomination of Donald Trump cited by 10 of respondents note the survey was fielded in the summer of 2016\n",

      "Meanwhile Republicans 32 are significantly more likely than Democrats 17 to say the response to 911 is the time in their lives when they felt the proudest of the country And a significantly larger share of Republicans 23 than Democrats 2 rate Obamas election and presidency as the most disappointing event in their lifetimes\n",

      "Historical background\n",
      "Main article History of terrorism\n",
      "Until David C Rapoport published his seminal article Fear and Trembling Terrorism in Three Religious Traditions in 1984 scholars of terrorism had largely assumed that terrorism was a modern phenomenon19 Earlier published studies like Paul Wilkinson had considered terrorism to be a product of 19th century revolutionary politics Technological developments like the pistol and bombmaking were considered instrumental to the relentless onslaught of assassinations terrorism bombings and political violence in the 19th century1920\n",
      "\n",
      "Rapoport proposed three case studies to demonstrate ancient lineage of religious terrorism which he called sacred terror the Thugs the Assassins and the Jewish Sicarii Zealots Rapoport argued religious terrorism has been ongoing since ancient times and that there are signs that it is reviving in new and unusual forms He is the first to propose that religious doctrines were more important than political rationales for some terrorist groups21 Rapoports work has since become the basis of the model of New Terrorism proposed by Bruce Hoffman and developed by other scholars22 New Terrorism has had an unparalleled impact on policymaking Critics have pointed out that the model is politically charged and oversimplified The underlying historical assertions have received less critical attention23 According to The Oxford Handbook on the History of Terrorism19\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the publication of Rapoports article it has become seemingly prerequisite for standard works on terrorism to cite the three case studies and to reproduce uncritically its findings In lieu of empirical research authors tend to crudely paraphrase Rapoport and the assumed relevance of Thuggee to the study of modern terrorism is taken for granted Yet the significance of the article is not simply a matter of citationsit has also provided the foundation for what has become known as the New Terrorism paradigm While Rapoport did not suggest which late 20th century groups might exemplify the implied recurrence of holy terror Bruce Hoffman recognized today as one of the worlds leading terrorism experts did not hesitate to do so A decade after Rapoports article Hoffman picked up the mantle and taking the three case studies as inspiration he formulated a model of contemporary holy terror or as he defined it terrorism motivated by a religious imperative Completely distinct from secular terrorists Hoffman argued that religious terrorists carry out indiscriminate acts of violence as a divine duty with no consideration for political efficacytheir aim is transcendental and holy terror constitutes an end in itself Hoffmans concept has since been taken up and developed by a number of other writers including Walter Laquer Steven Simon and Daniel Daniel Benjamen and rebranded as the New Terrorism\n",

      "Arguably the first organization to use modern terrorist techniques was the Irish Republican Brotherhood24 founded in 1858 as a revolutionary Irish nationalist group25 that carried out attacks in England26 The group initiated the Fenian dynamite campaign in 1881 one of the first modern terror campaigns27 Instead of earlier forms of terrorism based on political assassination this campaign used timed explosives with the express aim of sowing fear in the very heart of metropolitan Britain in order to achieve political gains28\n",
